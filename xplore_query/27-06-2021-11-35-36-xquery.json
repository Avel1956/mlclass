In order to improve the efficiency of the intrusion detection system and the corresponding mitigation action, it is important to address the problem of false alarms. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of two approaches that consider the false alarm minimization and alarm correlation techniques. The output of this analysis provides us the elements to propose a parallelizable strategy designed to achieve better results in terms of precision, recall and alarm load reduction in the prioritization of alarms. We use Prelude SIEM as the event normalizer in order to process security events from heterogeneous sensors and to correlate them. The alarms are verified using the dynamic network context information collected from the vulnerability analysis, and they are prioritized using the HP Arsight priority formula. The results show an important reduction in the volume of alerts, together with a high precision in the identification of false alarms.", "article_number": "8809121", "pdf_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8809121", "html_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8809121/", "abstract_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8809121/", "publication_title": "2019 IEEE Colombian Conference on Communications and Computing (COLCOM)", "conference_location": "Barranquilla, Colombia", "conference_dates": "5-7 June 2019", "publication_number": 8794647, "is_number": 8809081, "publication_year": 2019, "publication_date": "5-7 June 2019", "start_page": "1", "end_page": "6", "citing_paper_count": 1, "citing_patent_count": 0, "index_terms": {"ieee_terms": {"terms": ["Correlation", "Databases", "Minimization", "Sensors", "IP networks", "Measurement", "Intrusion detection"]}, "author_terms": {"terms": ["Signature-based IDS", "false alarm reduction", "similarity-based correlation", "alarm prioritization"]}}, "isbn_formats": {"isbns": [{"format": "Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN", "value": "978-1-7281-3504-5", "isbnType": "New-2005"}, {"format": "USB ISBN", "value": "978-1-7281-3502-1", "isbnType": "New-2005"}, {"format": "Electronic ISBN", "value": "978-1-7281-3503-8", "isbnType": "New-2005"}]}}, {"doi": "10.1109/ICCCC.2018.8390458", "title": "A load-based and fair radio access network selection strategy with traffic offloading in heterogeneous networks", "publisher": "IEEE", "isbn": "978-1-5386-1935-3", "rank": 2, "authors": {"authors": [{"affiliation": "Department of Informatic and Systems, Universidad EAFIT", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086264658", "id": 37086264658, "full_name": "Juan Montoya", "author_order": 1}, {"affiliation": "Department of Computer and Information Sciences, University of Delaware", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37267922600", "id": 37267922600, "full_name": "Adarshpal Sethi", "author_order": 2}, {"affiliation": "Department of Electronics Engineering, Universidad de Antioquia", "authorUrl": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38192337000", "id": 38192337000, "full_name": "Natalia Gaviria G\u00f3mez", "author_order": 3}]}, "access_type": "LOCKED", "content_type": "Conferences", "abstract": "Next Generation Mobile Networks are envisioned to integrate and coordinate Heterogeneous Networks with the aim to cope with the new mobile traffic demands by taking advantage of the features of each wireless network.

One of the main challenges for radio resource management architecture is the network selection function. We investigate the problem of Radio Access Network selection for a Heterogeneous Networks scenario with the objective of distributing the traffic among several Radio Access Networks in a fair way. The problem is theoretically modeled as a sequential decision-making problem using Semi Markovian Decision Process, where the optimization problem seeks to maximize the long-term discounted reward of the Heterogeneous Network system. In addition to this, taking advantage of the departure of sessions, we have considered a load distribution process that allows offloading of traffic to alleviate the load of the macro cell. In order to solve the model and obtain an optimal policy, we have used Value Iteration algorithm.

Peer-to-peer (P2P) streaming is a competitive technique in the distribution of video contents, thanks to its collaborative and sharing features. Nowadays, several applications distribute television contents over a P2P platform, broadcasting plenty of channels to an increasing audience. The performance of such applications over wireless networks is still an open issue, considering the highly variable environment, and the scarce resources. Most of these applications are developed to work properly over wired networks.

Although many proprietary solutions have been proposed, the standard IEEE 802.15.4 is about to become the global standard for WSN, since utilizes energy-efficient schemes to access the channel, and to transmit information at low speeds. However, this standard does not have a strategy for information differentiation, in which packets from nodes with a higher priority need to be sent sooner than packets from other nodes. Consequently, this paper evaluates, by means of numerical simulations, the assumption of an information differentiation scheme, which consists in modifying the Contention Window (CW) in the slotted IEEE 802.15.4, considering that nodes with lower CW values have higher probabilities to access the channel than nodes with higher CW values. Partial results show that this information differentiation scheme increases the channel access probability, when two or three levels of CW are implemented within the network.", "article_number": "6876903", "pdf_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6876903", "html_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876903/", "abstract_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876903/", "publication_title": "2014 9th Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies (CISTI)", "conference_location": "Barcelona, Spain", "conference_dates": "18-21 June 2014", "publication_number": 6867219, "is_number": 6876860, "publication_year": 2014, "publication_date": "18-21 June 2014", "start_page": "1", "end_page": "6", "citing_paper_count": 0, "citing_patent_count": 0, "index_terms": {"ieee_terms": {"terms": ["IEEE 802.15 Standards", "Object oriented modeling", "Multiaccess communication", "Wireless sensor networks", "Niobium", "Energy efficiency"]}, "author_terms": {"terms": ["IEEE 802.15.4", "Differentiated Traffic", "Contention Window"]}}, "isbn_formats": {"isbns": [{"format": "Electronic ISBN", "value": "978-9-8998-4343-1", "isbnType": "New-2005"}]}}]}
