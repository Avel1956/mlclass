For efficient retrieval and management, existing indexing solutions become inefficient with the rapidly growing index size and seek time and an optimized index scheme is required for big data. Regarding real-world applications, the indexing issue with big data in cloud computing is widespread in healthcare, enterprises, scientific experiments, and social networks. To date, diverse soft computing, machine learning, and other techniques in terms of artificial intelligence have been utilized to satisfy the indexing requirements, yet in the literature, there is no reported state-of-the-art survey investigating the performance and consequences of techniques for solving indexing in big data issues as they enter cloud computing. The objective of this paper is to investigate and examine the existing indexing techniques for big data. Taxonomy of indexing techniques is developed to provide insight to enable researchers understand and select a technique as a basis to design an indexing mechanism with reduced time and space consumption for BD-MCC. In this study, 48 indexing techniques have been studied and compared based on 60 articles related to the topic. The indexing techniques’ performance is analyzed based on their characteristics and big data indexing requirements. The main contribution of this study is taxonomy of categorized indexing techniques based on their method. The categories are non-artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence, and collaborative artificial intelligence indexing methods. In addition, the significance of different procedures and performance is analyzed, besides limitations of each technique. In conclusion, several key future research topics with potential to accelerate the progress and deployment of artificial intelligence-based cooperative indexing in BD-MCC are elaborated on. © 2015, Springer-Verlag London.",0,Artificial intelligence; Big data; Cloud computing; Collaborative artificial intelligence; Indexing,,"Gärtner, M., Rauber, A., Berger, H., Bridging structured and unstructured data via hybrid semantic search and interactive ontology-enhanced query formulation (2013) Knowl Inf Syst, pp. 1-32; Demirkan, H., Delen, D., Leveraging the capabilities of service-oriented decision support systems: putting analytics and big data in cloud (2013) Decis Support Syst, 55 (1), pp. 412-421; Amer-Yahia, S., Doan, A., Kleinberg, J., Koudas, N., Franklin, M., Crowds, clouds, and algorithms: exploring the human side of “big data” applications.

The unfolding of every event, breaking new or trend flows in real time inside OSN triggering a surge of opinionated networked content. An unprecedented scale of social relationships also diffuses across this vastly interconnected system affecting public behaviors and knowledge construction. Extracting intelligence from such data has becoming a quickly widening multidisciplinary area that demands the synergy of scientific tools and expertise. Key analysis practices include social network analysis, sentiment analysis, trend analysis and collaborative recommendation. Though, both their recent advent and the fact that science is still in the frontiers of processing human-generated data, provokes the need for an update and comprehensible taxonomy of the related research. In response to this chaotic emerging science of social data, this paper provides a sophisticated classification of state-of the-art frameworks considering the diversity of practices, methods and techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt that illustrated the entire spectrum of social data networking analysis and their associated frameworks.

We first provide a framework of how to describe and distinguish approaches to topic extraction from bibliographic data of scientific publications. We then compare solutions delivered by the different topic extraction approaches in this special issue, and explore where they agree and differ. This is achieved without reference to a ground truth, since we have to assume the existence of multiple, equally important, valid perspectives and want to avoid bias through the adoption of an ad-hoc yardstick. Instead, we apply different ways to quantitatively and visually compare solutions to explore their commonalities and differences and develop hypotheses about the origin of these differences. We conclude with a discussion of future work needed to develop methods for comparison and validation of topic extraction results, and express our concern about the lack of access to non-proprietary benchmark data sets to support method development in the field of scientometrics. © 2017, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",1,Astrophysics; Clustering; Comparative methods; Data modeling; Science mapping; Topic extraction; Topic labeling,,"Blondel, V.D., Guillaume, J.L., Lambiotte, R., Lefebvre, E., Fast unfolding of communities in large networks (2008) Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment, 2008 (10), p. 10,008; Boyack, K., Investigating the effect of global data on topic detection.

Forecasting (or prediction), similarly to other data mining tasks, uses empirical evidence to select the most suitable model for a problem at hand since no modeling method can be considered as the best. However, according to our systematic literature review of the last decade, few scientific publications rigorously expose the benefits and limitations of the most popular algorithms for time series prediction. At the same time, there is a limited performance record of these models when applied to complex and highly nonlinear data. In this paper, we present one of the most extensive, impartial and comprehensible experimental evaluations ever done in the time series prediction field. From 95 datasets, we evaluate eleven predictors, seven parametric and four non-parametric, employing two multi-step-ahead projection strategies and four performance evaluation measures. We report many lessons learned and recommendations concerning the advantages, drawbacks, and the best conditions for the use of each model. The results show that SARIMA is the only statistical method able to outperform, but without a statistical difference, the following machine learning algorithms: ANN, SVM, and kNN-TSPI. However, such forecasting accuracy comes at the expense of a larger number of parameters. The evaluated datasets, as well detailed results achieved by different indexes as MSE, Theil's U coefficient, POCID, and a recently-proposed multi-criteria performance measure are available online in our repository. Such repository is another contribution of this paper since other researchers can replicate our results and evaluate their methods more rigorously. The findings of this study will impact further research on this topic since they provide a broad insight into models selection, parameters setting, evaluation measures, and experimental setup. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",1,Automatic parameter tuning; Data mining; Multi-step-ahead prediction; Time series forecasting; Univariate analysis,Data mining; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Time series; Time series analysis; Automatic parameter tuning; Experimental evaluation; Machine learning models; Multi-step-ahead predictions; Statistical differences; Systematic literature review; Time series forecasting; Univariate analysis; Parameter estimation,"Ahmed, N.K., Atiya, A.F., Gayar, N.E., El-Shishiny, H., An empirical comparison of machine learning models for time series forecasting (2010) Econ.

The study involved a bibliometric analysis of statistical information from 408 scientific publications related to the theme, registered in the Scopus database, through a structured search equation. The collected records were used to calculate bibliometric indicators of quantity, quality and structure. Additionally, an analysis of increasing, decreasing, and emerging thematics was carried out to identify the topics of greatest interest on this subject. Findings indicate that this is a prolific research field, in which the fastest growing topic is the study of e-commerce adoption in small and medium sized enterprises in emerging economies. The analysis also revealed the current use of new models to evaluate adoption factors. That is the case of the Technology Organization Environment Framework used as an alternative to the Technology Acceptance Model--which remains the most widely used. Likewise, Structural Equation Analysis was found to be one of the most frequently used options for statistical analysis in the publications studied. A research agenda intending to contribute with directions for further research in the area is presented at the end of the article. © 2018 Universidad de Talca - Chile.",0,Adoption factors; Bibliometric analysis; Electronic commerce; Internet transactions; Research trends,,"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike other existing LBD methods, HBIN-LBD harnesses the metapath features found in HBIN graphs for discovering the latent associations between scientific papers published in otherwise disconnected research areas. Further, this paper investigates the effects of incorporating semantic and topic modeling components into the proposed models. Using time-sliced historical bibliographic data, we demonstrate the performance of our method by reconstructing two LBD hypotheses: the Fish Oil and Raynaud's Syndrome hypothesis and the Migraine and Magnesium hypothesis. The proposed method is capable of predicting the future co-citation links between research papers of these previously disconnected research areas with up to 88.86% accuracy and 0.89 F-measure. © 2016",1,Heterogeneous bibliographic information network; Link prediction; Literature-based discovery,Information services; Semantics; Bibliographic data; Bibliographic information networks; Cocitation; Link prediction; Literature-based discoveries; Research papers; Scientific papers; Topic Modeling; Bibliographies,"Banerjee, S., Pedersen, T., An adapted lesk algorithm for word sense disambiguation using wordnet (2002) Computational linguistics and intelligent text processing, pp. 136-145. , Springer; Bassecoulard, E., Zitt, M., Patents and Publications (2005), pp. 665-694. , Springer Netherlands; Beamer, S., Asanović, K., Patterson, D., Direction-optimizing breadth-first search (2013) Sci.

The Most Beneficial Collaborators (MBCs), who have high academic level and relevant research topics, can genuinely help researchers to enrich their research. However, how can we find the MBCs? In this paper, we propose a most Beneficial Collaborator Recommendation model called BCR. BCR learns on researchers’ publications and associates three academic features: topic distribution of research interest, interest variation with time and researchers’ impact in collaborators network. We run a topic model on researchers’ publications in each year for topic clustering. The generated topic distribution matrix is fixed by a time function to fit the interest dynamic transformation. The academic social impact is also considered to mine the most prolific researchers. Finally, a TopN MBCs recommendation list is generated according to the computed score. Extensive experiments on a dataset with citation network demonstrate that, in comparison to relevant baseline approaches, our BCR performs better in terms of precision, recall, F1 score and the recommendation quality. © 2017, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",0,Academic influence; Collaborator recommendation; Feature matrix; Research interest variation; Topic clustering,,"Abramo, G., D’Angelo, C.A., Di Costa, F., Research collaboration and productivity: Is there correlation?

Particularly in healthcare, where most processes are complex, variable, dynamic, and multi-disciplinary in nature, the application of this technique is growing yet challenging. Several literature reviews, as secondary studies, reveal the state of PM applications in healthcare from different perspectives, such as clinical pathways, oncology processes, and hospital management. In this article, we present the results of a systematic mapping (SM) study which we conducted to structure the information available in the primary studies. SM is a well-accepted method to identify and categorize research literature, in which the number of primary studies is rapidly growing. We searched for studies between 2005 and 2017 in the electronic digital libraries of scientific literature, and identified 172 studies out of the 2428 initially found on the topic of PM in healthcare. We created a concept map based on the information provided by the primary studies and classified these studies according to a number of attributes including the types of research and contribution, application context, healthcare specialty, mining activity, process modeling type and notation/language, and mining algorithm. We also reported the demographics and bibliometrics trends in this domain; namely, publication volume, top-cited papers, most contributing researchers and countries, and top venues. The results of mapping showed that, despite the healthcare data and technique related challenges, the field is rapidly growing and open for further research and practice. The researchers who are interested in the field could use the results to elicit opportunities for further research. The practitioners who are considering applications of PM, on the other hand, could observe the most common aims and specialties that PM techniques are applied. © 2013 IEEE.",0,Clinical pathway; healthcare process; process management; process mining; systematic mapping,Administrative data processing; Bibliographies; Data structures; Digital libraries; Enterprise resource management; Health care; Hospitals; Information management; Mapping; Medical computing; Oncology; Software engineering; Supply chains; Business process management; Clinical pathways; Healthcare process; Medical services; Process management; Process mining; Systematic mapping; Systematics; Data mining,"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The task is highly important for improving literature retrieval and many other scientific investigations in biomedical research. Unfortunately, given its manual nature, the process of MeSH indexing is both time-consuming (new articles are not immediately indexed until 2 or 3 months later) and costly (approximately ten dollars per article). In response, automatic indexing by computers has been previously proposed and attempted but remains challenging. In order to advance the state of the art in automatic MeSH indexing, a community-wide shared task called BioASQ was recently organized. Methods: We propose MeSH Now, an integrated approach that first uses multiple strategies to generate a combined list of candidate MeSH terms for a target article. Through a novel learning-to-rank framework, MeSH Now then ranks the list of candidate terms based on their relevance to the target article. Finally, MeSH Now selects the highest-ranked MeSH terms via a post-processing module. Results: We assessed MeSH Now on two separate benchmarking datasets using traditional precision, recall and F1-score metrics. In both evaluations, MeSH Now consistently achieved over 0.60 in F-score, ranging from 0.610 to 0.612. Furthermore, additional experiments show that MeSH Now can be optimized by parallel computing in order to process MEDLINE documents on a large scale. Conclusions: We conclude that MeSH Now is a robust approach with state-of-the-art performance for automatic MeSH indexing and that MeSH Now is capable of processing PubMed scale documents within a reasonable time frame.

The present study focuses on the analysis of the scientific production and performance of the Machine Learning and Big Data (MLBD) concepts. A bibliometric methodology of scientific mapping has been used, based on processes of estimation, quantification, analytical tracking, and evaluation of scientific research. A total of 4240 scientific publications from theWeb of Science (WoS) have been analyzed. Our results show a constant and ascending evolution of the scientific production on MLBD, 2018 and 2019 being the most productive years. The productions are mainly in English language. The topics are variable in the different periods analyzed, where ""machine-learning"" is the one that shows the greatest bibliometric indicators, it is found in most of motor topics and is the one that offers the greatest line of continuity between the different periods. It can be concluded that research on MLBD is of interest and relevance to the scientific community, which focuses its studies on the branch of machine-learning. © 2020 by the authors.",0,Bibliometric analysis; Big data; Machine learning; Scientific production; Web of science,,"Qiu, J., Wu, Q., Ding, G., Xu, Y., Feng, S., Erratum to: A survey of machine learning for big data processing (2016) EURASIP J.

As a result, a considerable amount of research has been published trying to solve open problems and improving existing models. This survey will bring additional structure into the already conducted research on both topics. After recapitulating the major underlying concepts, a new integrated review and analysis scheme for reputation and trust models is put forward. Using highly recognized review papers in this domain as a basis, this article will also introduce additional evaluation metrics to account for characteristics so far unstudied. A subsequent application of the new review schema on 40 top recent publications in this scientific field revealed interesting insights. While the area of computational trust and reputation models is still a very active research branch, the analysis carried out here was able to show that some aspects have already started to converge, whereas others are still subject to vivid discussions. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",0,,Surveys; Additional structures; Computational trust; Evaluation metrics; Review papers; Scientific fields; Trust models; Human computer interaction,"Abdel-Hafez, A., Tang, X., Tian, N., Xu, Y., A reputation-enhanced recommender system (2014) Advanced Data Mining and Applications, pp. 185-198. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-14717-8_15, Xudong Luo, Jeffrey Xu Yu, and Zhi Li (Eds) Springer, Cham; Abdel-Hafez, A., Xu, Y., Jang, A., A normal-distribution based rating aggregation method for generating product reputations (2015) Web Intell, 13 (1), pp. 43-51. , https://doi.org/10.3233/WEB-150306, Apr 2015; Abdul-Rahman, A., Hailes, S., Supporting trust in virtual communities (2000) Proceedings of the 33rd Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 1. , https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.2000.926814, IEEE Computer Society 9; Acampora, G., Alghazzawi, D., Hagras, H., Vitiello, A., An interval type-2 fuzzy logic based framework for reputation management in Peer-To-Peer e-commerce (2016) Info.

As a result, new evaluative tools are needed to help assess not only the knowledge production side of research programmes or organisations, but also the articulation of research agendas with societal needs. In this paper, we present an exploratory investigation of science supply and societal needs on the grand challenge of obesity – an emerging health problem with enormous social costs. We illustrate a potential approach that uses topic modelling to explore: (a) how scientific publications can be used to describe existing priorities in science production; (b) how policy records (in this case here questions posed in the European parliament) can be used as an instance of mapping discourse of social needs; (c) how the comparison between the two may show (mis)alignments between societal concerns and scientific outputs. While this is a technical exercise, we propose that this type of mapping methods can be useful to domain experts for informing strategic planning and evaluation in funding agencies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",0,Obesity; Research agenda; Science mapping; Societal needs; Topic modeling,Nutrition; European Parliament; Knowledge production; Obesity; Research agenda; Research programmes; Scientific publications; Societal needs; Topic Modeling; Mapping,"Aaron, D.G., Siegel, M.B., Sponsorship of national health organizations by two major soda companies (2017) American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 52 (1), pp. 20-30; Basdevant, A., Obesity plan: Empowerment and then?

Prior research on topic evolution has often leveraged refinements to Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify emerging topics. However, such methods do not answer the question of which studies contributed to the evolution of a topic. In this paper we show that meta-paths over a heterogeneous bibliographic network (consisting of papers, authors and venues) can be used to identify the network elements that made the greatest contributions to a topic. In particular, by adding derived edges that capture the contribution of papers, authors, and venues to a topic (using PageRank algorithm), a restricted meta-path over the bibliographic network can be used to restrict the evolution of topics to the context of interest to a researcher. We use such restricted meta-paths to construct a topic evolution tree that can provide researchers with a web-based visualization of the evolution of a scientific topic in the context of interest to them. Compared to baseline networks without restrictions, we find that restricted networks provide more useful topic evolution trees. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",1,Heterogeneous bibliographic network; Meta-path; Topic evolution; Visualization,Algorithms; Flow visualization; Forestry; Statistics; Visualization; Baseline network; Context of interests; Emerging topics; Latent dirichlet allocations; Meta-path; PageRank algorithm; Topic evolution; Web-based visualization; Bibliographies,"Barile, S., Franco, G., Nota, G., Saviano, M., Structure and dynamics of a T-shaped knowledge: from individuals to cooperating communities of practice (2012) Service Science, 4 (2), pp. 161-180; Bates, M.J., Indexing and access for digital libraries and the Internet: human, database, and domain factors (1998) Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 49 (13), pp. 1185-1205; Beck, J., Randall, L., NLM DTD to NISO JATS Z39. 96-2012 (2013) The NCBI Handbook [Internet], , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK169004/, National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda MD, Accessed 28.08.15; Blei, D.M., Lafferty, J.D., Dynamic topic models (2006) Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on machine learning, ACM, pp. 113-120; Blei, D.M., Ng, A.Y., Jordan, M.I., Latent Dirichlet allocation (2003) The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3 (MARCH), pp. 993-1022; Bolelli, L., Ertekin, S., Zhou, D., Giles, C.L., Finding topic trends in digital libraries (2009) Proceedings of the 9th ACM/IEEE-CS joint conference on digital libraries (JCDL '09), ACM, pp. 69-72; Bornmann, L., Mutz, R., Growth rates of modern science: a bibliometric analysis based on the number of publications and cited references (2015) Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 66 (11), pp. 2215-2222; Chen, C., CiteSpace II: Detecting and visualizing emerging trends and transient patterns in scientific literature (2006) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 57 (3), pp. 359-377; Cheung, W.A., Ouellette, B.F.F., Wasserman, W.W., Quantitative biomedical annotation using medical subject heading overrepresentation profiles (meshops) (2012) BMC Bioinformatics, 13 (1), p. 249; Donofrio, N., Spohrer, J., Zadeh, H., Research-driven medical education and practice: a case for T-shaped professionals (2010) IBM working document, , http://www.ceri.msu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/A-Case-for-T-Shaped-Professionals-20090907-Hossein.pdf, Last downloaded 02.08.15 from:; Evans, J.A., Foster, J.G., (2011) Metaknowledge.

Method: The approach uses a two-stage pipeline, combining a dictionary-based entity recognizer with a machine-learning classifier. First, the OGER entity recognizer, which has a bias towards high recall, annotates the terms that appear in selected domain ontologies. Subsequently, the Distiller framework uses this information as a feature for a machine learning algorithm to select the relevant entities only. For this step, we compare two different supervised machine-learning algorithms: Conditional Random Fields and Neural Networks. Results: In an in-domain evaluation using the CRAFT corpus, we test the performance of the combined systems when recognizing chemicals, cell types, cellular components, biological processes, molecular functions, organisms, proteins, and biological sequences. Our best system combines dictionary-based candidate generation with Neural-Network-based filtering. It achieves an overall precision of 86% at a recall of 60% on the named entity recognition task, and a precision of 51% at a recall of 49% on the concept recognition task. Conclusion: These results are to our knowledge the best reported so far in this particular task. © 2017 The Author(s).",0,Machine learning; Named entity recognition; Natural language processing; Text mining,"algorithm; artificial neural network; automated pattern recognition; controlled vocabulary; data mining; machine learning; nomenclature; procedures; reproducibility; semantics; Algorithms; Data Mining; Machine Learning; Neural Networks (Computer); Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Semantics; Terminology as Topic; Vocabulary, Controlled","Leser, U., Hakenberg, J., What makes a gene name? named entity recognition in the biomedical literature (2005) Brief Bioinform, 6 (4), p. 357; Narayanaswamy, M., Ravikumar, K.E., Vijay-Shanker, K., A biological named entity recognizer (2003) Pac Symp Biocomput, p. 8; Koning, D., Sarkar, I.N., Moritz, T., TaxonGrab: extracting taxonomic names from text (2005) Biodivers Inform, 2, pp. 79-82; Sharma, V., Sarkar, I.N., ChemGrab: identification of chemical names using a combined negative-dictionary and rule-based approach (2017) Proceedings of the BioCreative V.5 Challenge Evaluation Workshop, pp. 96-103. , Barcelona; Pafilis, E., Frankild, S.P., Fanini, L., Faulwetter, S., Pavloudi, C., Vasileiadou, A., Arvanitidis, C., Jensen, L.J., The SPECIES and ORGANISMS resources for fast and accurate identification of taxonomic names in text (2013) PLOS ONE, 8 (6), pp. 1-6; Jessop, D.M., Adams, S.E., Willighagen, E.L., Hawizy, L., Murray-Rust, P., OSCAR4: a flexible architecture for chemical text-mining (2011) J Cheminformatics, 3 (1), p. 41; Leaman, R., Wei, C.H., Lu, Z., tmChem: a high performance approach for chemical named entity recognition and normalization (2015) J Cheminformatics, 7, p. 3. , S-1; Munkhdalai, T., Li, M., Batsuren, K., Park, H.A., Choi, N.H., Ryu, K.H., Incorporating domain knowledge in chemical and biomedical named entity recognition with word representations (2015) J Cheminformatics, 7 (1), p. 9; Sasaki, Y., Tsuruoka, Y., McNaught, J., Ananiadou, S., How to make the most of NE dictionaries in statistical NER (2008) BMC Bioinforma, 9 (11), p. 1; Akhondi, S.A., Pons, E., Afzal, Z., van Haagen, H., Becker, B.F., Hettne, K.M., van Mulligen, E.M., Kors, J.A., Chemical entity recognition in patents by combining dictionary-based and statistical approaches (2016) Database, 2016, p. 61; Basaldella, M., Furrer, L., Colic, N., Ellendorff, T.R., Tasso, C., Rinaldi, F., Using a hybrid approach for entity recognition in the biomedical domain (2016) Proceedings of the 7th International Symposium on Semantic Mining in Biomedicine (SMBM 2016), , Potsdam; Rinaldi, F., Schneider, G., Clematide, S., Grigonyte, G., Notes about the OntoGene pipeline (2012) AAAI-2012 Fall Symposium on Information Retrieval and Knowledge Discovery in Biomedical Text, , November 2-4.

Document clustering has been used for topic detection at the document level. Probabilistic topic models treat topics as a distribution over the term space, but this approach overlooks the semantic information hidden in the topic. Thus, representing topics without loss of semantic information as well as detecting the optimal topic is a challenging task. In this study, we built topics using a network called a topic graph, where the topics were represented as concept nodes and their semantic relationships using WordNet. Next, we extracted each topic from the topic graph to obtain a corpus by community discovery. In order to find the optimal topic to describe the related corpus, we defined a topic pruning process, which was used for topic detection. We then performed topic pruning using Markov decision processes, which transformed topic detection into a dynamic programming problem. Experimental results produced using a newsgroup corpus and a science literature corpus showed that our method obtained almost the same precision and recall as baseline models such as latent Dirichlet allocation and KeyGraph. In addition, our method performed better than the probabilistic topic model in terms of its explanatory power and the runtime was lower compared with all three baseline methods, while it can also be optimized to adapt the corpus better by using topic pruning. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",1,Community discovery; Markov Decision Process; Topic detection; Topic graph; Topic pruning,Behavioral research; Dynamic programming; Information retrieval; Learning algorithms; Markov processes; Probability distributions; Semantics; Social aspects; Statistics; Community discoveries; Markov Decision Processes; Topic detection; Topic graph; Topic pruning; Data mining; algorithm; Article; calculation; controlled study; decision making; dynamics; human; Markov chain; Markov decision processes; mathematical computing; mathematical model; network learning; priority journal; scientific literature; semantics; statistical analysis,"Berry, M.W., Kogan, J., (2010) Text Mining: Applications and Theory, , John Wiley &Sons; Allan, J., Papka, R., Lavrenko, V., On-line new event detection and tracking (1998) Proceedings of the 21st Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, Melbourne, Australia, pp. 137-145; Petkos, G., Papadopoulos, S., Aiello, L., A soft frequent pattern mining approach for textual topic detection (2014) Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Web Intelligence, Mining and Semantics (WIMS14), Thessaloniki, Greece, pp. 251-25:10; Blei, D.M., Ng, A.Y., Jordan, M.I., Latent dirichlet allocation (2003) J.

In this paper, we demonstrate a new approach to the delineation of thematic structures that attempts to match the algorithm to theoretically derived and empirically observed properties all thematic structures have in common. We cluster citation links rather than publication nodes, use predominantly local information and search for communities of links starting from seed subgraphs in order to allow for pervasive overlaps of topics. We evaluate sets of links with a new cost function and assume that local minima in the cost landscape correspond to link communities. Because this cost landscape has many local minima we define a valid community as the community with the lowest minimum within a certain range. Since finding all valid communities is impossible for large networks, we designed a memetic algorithm that combines probabilistic evolutionary strategies with deterministic local searches. We apply our approach to a network of about 15,000 Astronomy and Astrophysics papers published 2010 and their cited sources, and to a network of about 100,000 Astronomy and Astrophysics papers (published 2003–2010) which are linked through direct citations. © 2017, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",1,Astrophysics; Citation networks; Link clustering; Memetic algorithm; Overlapping topics,,"Ahn, Y.-Y., Bagrow, J.P., Lehmann, S., Link communities reveal multi-scale complexity in networks (2010) Nature, 466, pp. 761-764. , Cf. arXiv preprint arXiv:0903.3178.

Wang Q.,57201920890;,Distribution features and intellectual structures of digital humanities: A bibliometric analysis,2018,Journal of Documentation,74,1,12,10.1108/JD-05-2017-0076,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85033553377&doi=10.1108%2fJD-05-2017-0076&partnerID=40&md5=86f72267ee87755bcd08c8d56203cfd6,"Business School, Nankai University, Tianjin, China","Wang, Q., Business School, Nankai University, Tianjin, China","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to conduct a retrospective bibliometric analysis of documents about digital humanities, an emerging but interdisciplinary movement. It examines the distribution of research outputs and languages, identifies the active journals and institutions, dissects the network of categories and cited references, and interprets the hot research topics. Design/methodology/approach: The source data are derived from the Web of Science (WoS) core collection. To reveal the holistic landscape of this field, VOSviewer and CiteSpace as popular visualization tools are employed to process the bibliographic data including author, category, reference, and keyword. Furthermore, the parameter design of the visualization tools follows the general procedures and methods for bibliometric analysis. Findings: There is an obviously rapid growth in digital humanities research. English is still the leading academic language in this field. The most influential authors all come from or have scientific relationships with Europe and North America, and two leading countries of which are the UK and USA. Digital humanities is the result of a dynamic dialogue between humanistic exploration and digital means. This research field is closely associated with history, literary and cultural heritage, and information and library science. Research limitations/implications: This analysis relies on the metadata information extracted from the WoS database; however, some valuable literatures in the field of digital humanities may not be retrieved from the database owing to the inherent challenge of topic search. This study is also restricted by the scope of publications, the limitation regarding the source of data is that WoS database may have underrepresented publications in this domain. Originality/value: The output of this paper could be a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners interesting in the knowledge domain of digital humanities. Moreover, the conclusions of this retrospective analysis can be deemed as the comparable foundation for future study. © 2018, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",0,CiteSpace; Digital cultural heritage; Digital history; Digital humanities; Digital literary; Humanities computing; Library and information services; Visualization analysis; VOSviewer,,"Adams, B., Gahegan, M., Exploratory chronotopic data analysis (2016) Geographic Information Science (GIScience), pp. 243-258. , Miller, J.A., Osullivan, D. and Wiegand, N.and (Eds), Springer, Montreal; Baena-Sanchez, F., Fernandez-Travieso, C., Espejo-Cala, C., Diaz-Noci, J., Encoding and mapping news.

In computation research, full replication is often unrealistic for independent results validation, therefore, study reproduction has been justified as the minimum acceptable standard to evaluate the validity of scientific claims. The application of text mining techniques to citation screening in the context of systematic literature reviews is a relatively young and growing computational field with high relevance for software engineering, medical research and other fields. However, there is little work so far on reproduction studies in the field. Objective In this paper, we investigate the reproducibility of studies in this area based on information contained in published articles and we propose reporting guidelines that could improve reproducibility. Methods The study was approached in two ways. Initially we attempted to reproduce results from six studies, which were based on the same raw dataset. Then, based on this experience, we identified steps considered essential to successful reproduction of text mining experiments and characterized them to measure how reproducible is a study given the information provided on these steps. 33 articles were systematically assessed for reproducibility using this approach. Results Our work revealed that it is currently difficult if not impossible to independently reproduce the results published in any of the studies investigated. The lack of information about the datasets used limits reproducibility of about 80% of the studies assessed. Also, information about the machine learning algorithms is inadequate in about 27% of the papers. On the plus side, the third party software tools used are mostly free and available. Conclusions The reproducibility potential of most of the studies can be significantly improved if more attention is paid to information provided on the datasets used, how they were partitioned and utilized, and how any randomization was controlled. We introduce a checklist of information that needs to be provided in order to ensure that a published study can be reproduced. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0,Citation screening; Reproducibility; Reproducible research; Systematic review; Text mining,Application programs; Diagnosis; Learning algorithms; Publishing; Software engineering; Context independent; Reproducibilities; Reproducible research; Systematic literature review; Systematic Review; Text mining; Text mining techniques; Third party software; Data mining; access to information; Article; automation; citation analysis; data analysis; data analysis software; data mining; information processing; machine learning; mathematical analysis; medical research; perceptron; practice guideline; priority journal; reproducibility; support vector machine; systematic review (topic); checklist; human; literature; publication; reproducibility; Biomedical Research; Checklist; Data Mining; Humans; Publications; Reproducibility of Results; Review Literature as Topic,"Donoho, D.L., Maleki, A., Rahman, I.U., Shahram, M., Stodden, V., Reproducible research in computational harmonic analysis (2009) Comput.

Interplay is vital between those involved in refining bibliometric methods and the recipients of this type of analysis. Production as well as citations patterns reflect working methodologies in different disciplines within the specialized Library and Information Science (LIS) field, as well as in the non-specialist (non-LIS) professional field. We extract the literature on bibliometric analyses from Web of Science in all fields of science and analyze clustering of co-occurring keywords at an aggregate level. It reveals areas of interconnected literature with different impact on the LIS and the non-LIS community.We classify and categorize bibliometric articles that obtain the most citations in accordance with a modified version of Derrick’s, Jonker’s and Lewison’s method (Derrick et al. in Proceedings, 17th international conference on science and technology indicators. STI, Montreal, 2012). The data demonstrates that cross-referencing between the LIS and the non-LIS field is modest in publications outside their main categories of interest, i.e. discussions of various bibliometric issues or strict analyses of various topics. We identify some fields as less well-covered bibliometrically. © 2018, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",0,Bibliometric analysis; Citation analysis; Policy implications; Publication analysis,,"Abbott, A., Cyranoski, D., Jones, N., Maher, B., Schiermeier, Q., Van Noorden, R., Do metrics matter?

In this paper, we propose a pipeline model, named collective topical PageRank, to evaluate the topic-dependent impact of scientific papers. First, we fit the model to a correlation topic model based on the textual content of papers to extract scientific topics and correlations. Then, we present a modified PageRank algorithm, which incorporates the venue, the correlations of the scientific topics, and the publication year of each paper into a random walk to evaluate the paper’s topic-dependent academic impact. Our experiments showed that the model can effectively identify significant papers as well as venues for each scientific topic, recommend papers for further reading or citing, explore the evolution of scientific topics, and calculate the venues’ dynamic topic-dependent academic impact. © 2017, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",1,PageRank; Scientific evaluation; Topic model,,"Bethard, S., Dan, J., (2010) Who should i cite: Learning literature search models from citation behavior.

Scientists increasingly rely on intelligent information systems to help them in their daily tasks, in particular for managing research objects, like publications or datasets. The relatively young research field of Semantic Publishing has been addressing the question how scientific applications can be improved through semantically rich representations of research objects, in order to facilitate their discovery and re-use. To complement the efforts in this area, we propose an automatic workflow to construct semantic user profiles of scholars, so that scholarly applications, like digital libraries or data repositories, can better understand their users' interests, tasks, and competences, by incorporating these user profiles in their design. To make the user profiles sharable across applications, we propose to build them based on standard semantic web technologies, in particular the Resource Description Framework (RDF) for representing user profiles and Linked Open Data (LOD) sources for representing competence topics. To avoid the cold start problem, we suggest to automatically populate these profiles by analyzing the publications (co-)authored by users, which we hypothesize reflect their research competences. Results. We developed a novel approach, ScholarLens, which can automatically generate semantic user profiles for authors of scholarly literature. For modeling the competences of scholarly users and groups, we surveyed a number of existing linked open data vocabularies. In accordance with the LOD best practices, we propose an RDF Schema (RDFS) based model for competence records that reuses existing vocabularies where appropriate. To automate the creation of semantic user profiles, we developed a complete, automated workflow that can generate semantic user profiles by analyzing full-text research articles through various natural language processing (NLP) techniques. In our method, we start by processing a set of research articles for a given user. Competences are derived by text mining the articles, including syntactic, semantic, and LOD entity linking steps. We then populate a knowledge base in RDF format with user profiles containing the extracted competences.We implemented our approach as an open source library and evaluated our system through two user studies, resulting in mean average precision (MAP) of up to 95%. As part of the evaluation, we also analyze the impact of semantic zoning of research articles on the accuracy of the resulting profiles. Finally, we demonstrate how these semantic user profiles can be applied in a number of use cases, including article ranking for personalized search and finding scientists competent in a topic -e.g., to find reviewers for a paper.

Design/methodology/approach-Facebook posts citing psychological journal papers were collected for both quantitative and qualitative analyses. A content analysis approach was adopted to investigate topic preferences and motivations for scholarly discussions among academic and non-academic Facebook users. Findings-Non-academic users were more actively engaged in scholarly discussions on Facebook than academic users. Among 1, 711 Facebook users in the sample, 71.4 percent of them belonged to non-academic users, while 28.6 percent were from an academic background. The Facebook users cited psychological articles with various motivations: discussion and evaluation toward articles (20.4 percent), application to real life practices (16.5 percent), self-promotion (6.4 percent), and data source exchange (6.0 percent). However, nearly half of the posts (50.1 percent) were simply sharing articles without additional user comments. These results implicate that Facebook metric (a count of mentions of a research article on Facebook), as an important source of altmetrics, better reflects the attitudes or perceptions of the general public instead of academia. Originality/value-This study contributes to the literature by enriching the understanding of Facebook metric as an academic and non-academic impact assessment tool for scientific publication. Through the content analysis of Facebook posts, it also draws insights into the ways in which non-academic audiences are engaging with scholarly outputs. © Emerald Publishing Limited.",0,Altmetrics; Content analysis; Facebook; Psychology; Scholarly communication,Education; Motivation; Social networking (online); Altmetrics; Content analysis; Facebook; Psychology; Scholarly communication; Data mining; content analysis; human; human experiment; instrument validation; motivation; perception; publication; qualitative analysis; validity,"Blei, D.M., Ng, A.Y., Jordan, M.I., Latent dirichlet allocation (2003) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3 (4-5), pp. 993-1022; Bornmann, L., What is social impact of research and how can it be assessed?

Previous studies on the linkages mainly focus on the analysis of nonpatent references on the front page of patents, or the resulting citation-link networks, but with unsatisfactory performance. In the meanwhile, abundant mentioned entities in the scholarly articles and patents further complicate topic linkages. To deal with this situation, a novel statistical entity-topic model (named the CCorrLDA2 model), armed with the collapsed Gibbs sampling inference algorithm, is proposed to discover the hidden topics respectively from the academic articles and patents. In order to reduce the negative impact on topic similarity calculation, word tokens and entity mentions are grouped by the Brown clustering method. Then a topic linkages construction problem is transformed into the well-known optimal transportation problem after topic similarity is calculated on the basis of symmetrized Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence. Extensive experimental results indicate that our approach is feasible to build topic linkages with more superior performance than the counterparts. © 2019 ASIS&T",0,,Inference engines; Sampling; Clustering methods; Construction problem; Inference algorithm; Optimal transportations; Scholarly articles; Science and Technology; Scientific publications; Topic similarity; Patents and inventions; article; calculation; patent; publication; sampling,"Albert, T., (2016) Measuring technology maturity: Operationalizing information from patents, scientific publications and the web, , Wiesbaden, Germany, Springer Gabler; Andrieu, C., de Freitas, N., Doucet, A., Jordan, M.I., An introduction to MCMC for machine learning (2003) Machine Learning, 50 (1-2), pp. 5-43; Asuncion, A., Welling, M., Smyth, P., Teh, Y.W., (2009), pp. 27-34. , .

Medical informatics (MI) is an important cross-disciplinary field that, along with its applications, has received massive funding from the Chinese government. However, the question of how to evaluate China's input and output in MI remains important and complex issue of great significance for China and the rest of the world. Objective: This paper analyzed, for the first time, the quality and quantity of research by Chinese academics in MI based on their articles published in international specialty journals in recent years and examined MI research hotspots in China. Our purpose is to summarize the experiences and lessons learned by China and the rest of the world as they develop MI. Method: We targeted 18 MI journals listed in the JCR 2016 report and searched for papers published by Chinese academics in these 18 journals in the WOS and PUBMED databases and on journal sites. We also performed data cleansing and categorized the obtained information. We used Excel, SPSS, Ucinet and NetDraw to conduct quantitative analyses on the research papers. Results: A total of 1340 articles satisfied the inclusion criteria of this study. We observed a significant upward trend in the number of articles published over time, particularly after 2011. Lei Jianbo, Huang Zhengxing and Li Jin-song are active Chinese authors in the MI discipline who have written many high-quality publications. Meanwhile, universities remain the primary breeding grounds for scientific research: 93.36% of the articles came from universities. Zhejiang University published the most first-author articles, whereas Zhejiang University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Tsinghua University produced 17.76% of the total articles. According to the lists of authors, 24% of the papers were co-authored with foreign researchers. This rate of cooperation is increasing each year, from 5.88% to the current rate of 39.04%. An analysis of keywords showed that “EMR” “SVM” “Authentication” “Telecare medical information system” “EEG” “ECG” and “RFID” were the most frequently searched terms in popular technological fields, including artificial intelligence and image processing. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of high-frequency keywords and a broadening range of research fields, which has led to the emergence of several research hotspots, including MI systems, mobile health care, telecare, data mining and machine learning. Conclusions: Through the quantitative analysis of publications, we discovered the emergence of three stages – infancy, slow growth and rapid growth – in China's MI research in recent years as academics make achievements in their research works. The global influence of Chinese academics is growing, and they are making increasingly conscious efforts to enter into research collaborations with foreign researchers. The findings of Chinese academics’ publications are gaining international recognition. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",0,Article; China; Discipline development; Medical informatics; Output; Research paper quantitative analysis,"Artificial intelligence; Chemical analysis; Data mining; Image processing; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Publishing; Search engines; Article; China; Discipline development; Medical informatics; Output; Research papers; Medical information systems; Article; artificial intelligence; China; clinical outcome; data mining; human; image processing; medical informatics; medical information system; medical literature; Medline; quantitative analysis; systematic review; Web of Science; bibliometrics; evaluation study; factual database; medical informatics; publication; research; statistics and numerical data; trends; university; Bibliometrics; China; Databases, Factual; Humans; Medical Informatics; Periodicals as Topic; Publications; Research; Universities","Patel, V.L., Arocha, J.F., Kaufman, D.R., A primer on aspects of cognition for medical informatics (2001) J.

The Author-Topic Model (ATM) is a generative model that represents the relationships between research topics and publication authors. It allows us to identify the most influential authors on a particular topic. However, since most research works are co-authored by many researchers the information provided by ATM can be complemented by the study of the most fruitful collaborations among multiple authors. This paper addresses the discovery of research collaborations among multiple authors on single or multiple topics. Specifically, it exploits an exploratory data mining technique, i.e., weighted association rule mining, to analyze publication data and to discover correlations between ATM topics and combinations of authors. The mined rules characterize groups of researchers with fairly high scientific productivity by indicating (1) the research topics covered by their most cited publications and the relevance of their scientific production separately for each topic, (2) the nature of the collaboration (topic-specific or cross-topic), (3) the name of the external authors who have (occasionally) collaborated with the group either on a specific topic or on multiple topics, and (4) the underlying correlations between the addressed topics. The applicability of the proposed approach was validated on real data acquired from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man catalog of genetic disorders and from the PubMed digital library. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. © 2018, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",1,Author Topic Model; Data mining; Knowledge discovery; Weighted association rule mining,,"Agrawal, R., Srikant, R., Fast algorithms for mining association rules in large databases (1994) Proceedings of the 20Th VLDB Conference, pp. 487-499; Agrawal, R., Imielinski, T., Swami, A., Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases (1993) In ACM SIGMOD, 1993, pp. 207-216; Baralis, E., Cagliero, L., Cerquitelli, T., Garza, P., Generalized association rule mining with constraints (2012) Information Sciences, 194, pp. 68-84; Blei, D.M., Ng, A.Y., Jordan, M.I., Latent dirichlet allocation (2003) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3, pp. 993-1022. , http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=944919.944937; Brin, S., Page, L., The anatomy of a large-scale hypertextual web search engine (1998) Seventh International World-Wide Web Conference (WWW 1998), , http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/361/; Cagliero, L., Garza, P., Infrequent weighted itemset mining using frequent pattern growth (2014) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 26 (4), pp. 903-915; Cagliero, L., Garza, P., Kavoosifar, M.R., Baralis, E., Identifying collaborations among researchers: A pattern-based approach (2017) Proceedings of the 2Nd Joint Workshop on Bibliometric-Enhanced Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing for Digital Libraries (BIRNDL 2017) Co-Located with the 40Th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR 2017), 2017, pp. 56-68. , http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1888/paper5.pdf, Tokyo, Japan, August 11; Ding, Y., Zhang, G., Chambers, T., Song, M., Wang, X., Zhai, C., Content-based citation analysis: The next generation of citation analysis (2014) JASIST, 65, pp. 1820-1833; Dong, G., Li, J., Efficient mining of emerging patterns: Discovering trends and differences (1999) Proceedings of the Fifth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 43-52. , https://doi.org/10.1145/312129.312191, ACM, New York, NY, USA, KDD ’99; Hamosh, A., Scott, A., Amberger, J., Valle, D., McKusick, V., Online mendelian inheritance in man (OMIM) (2000) Human Mutation, 15 (1), pp. 57-61; Han, J., Pei, J., Yin, Y., (2000) Mining frequent patterns without candidate generation, , SIGMOD’00, Dallas, TX; Hirsch, J.E., An index to quantify an individual’s scientific research output that takes into account the effect of multiple coauthorship (2010) Scientometrics, 85 (3), pp. 741-754; Kim, H.J., An, J., Jeong, Y.K., Song, M., Exploring the leading authors and journals in major topics by citation sentences and topic modeling (2016) In BIRNDL@JCDL; Kou, N.M., Hou, U.L., Mamoulis, N., Gong, Z., Weighted coverage based reviewer assignment (2015) Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 2031-2046. , https://doi.org/10.1145/2723372.2723727, (a), ACM, New York, NY, USA, SIGMOD ’15; Kou, N.M., Mamoulis, N., Li, Y., Li, Y., Gong, Z., A topic-based reviewer assignment system (2015) Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 8 (12), pp. 1852-1855; Li, B., Hou, Y.T., The new automated IEEE INFOCOM review assignment system (2016) IEEE Network, 30 (5), pp. 18-24; Liu, B., Hsu, W., Chen, S., Ma, Y., Analyzing the subjective interestingness of association rules (2000) IEEE Intelligent Systems and Their Applications, 15 (5), pp. 47-55; Loper, E., Bird, S., NLTK: The natural language toolkit (2002) Proceedings of the ACL-02 Workshop on Effective Tools and Methodologies for Teaching Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics, 1, pp. 63-70. , https://doi.org/10.3115/1118108.1118117, Association for Computational Linguistics, Stroudsburg, PA, USA, ETMTNLP ’02; Lu, C., Zhang, C., Ma, S., How does citing behavior for a scientific article change over time?

In scientific publications, a review paper discusses a professional field and thus tends to have more citations than general papers do. This study investigated whether specific characteristics of review papers induce different results in citation-based analysis. From the Scopus database, we collected scientific publications in a specific research field, e-tourism, to examine the role of review papers in citation-based analysis. The dataset includes 1421 publications covering the period from the 1988–2015. Empirical statistics show that review papers’ specific citation patterns influence citation analysis. First, in the main path analysis, the result expresses review papers’ integrative role in linking papers from diverse perspectives toward a clear mainstream topic. Second, in a well-defined research context, review papers introduce bias in citation-based clustering analysis because the specific high citation pattern in review papers obfuscates the grouping process. When using citation information in analysis, scholars must consider the purpose of the study and treat review papers distinctly to avoid bias when using certain analysis methods and datasets. © 2016, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",0,Bibliometrics; Citation network; Citation-based analysis; Cluster analysis; Review paper,,"Acs, Z.J., Audretsch, D.B., Feldman, M.P., Research-and-development spillovers and recipient firm size (1994) Review of Economics and Statistics, 76 (2), pp. 336-340; Amaro, S., Duarte, P., Online travel purchasing: A literature review (2013) Journal of Travel & Tourism Marketing, 30 (8), pp. 755-785; Anselin, L., Varga, A., Acs, Z., Geographical spillovers and university research: A spatial econometric perspective (2000) Growth and Change, 31 (4), pp. 501-515; Barrios, M., Guilera, G., Gomez-Benito, J., Impact of meta-analytical studies, standard articles and reviews: Similarities and differences, 14th International Society of Scientormetrics and Informatrics Conference 2013, Vienna (2013) Austria, pp. 966-977; http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.DL/0309023, Batagelj, V.

Works by prominent authors tend to receive disproportionately many citations, while publications by less well-known researchers covering the same topics may not attract as much attention. In this paper we address the shortcomings of traditional scientometric approaches by proposing a novel method that utilizes a classifier for predicting publication years based on latent topic distributions. We then calculate real-number innovation scores used to identify potential breakthrough papers and turnaround years. The proposed approach can complement existing citation-based measures of article importance and author contribution analysis; it opens as well novel research direction for time-based, innovation-centered research scientific output evaluation. In our experiments, we focus on two corpora of research papers published over several decades at two well-established conferences: The World Wide Web Conference (WWW) and the International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR), containing around 3500 documents in total. We indicate significant years and demonstrate examples of highly-ranked papers, thus providing a novel insight on the evolution of the two conferences. Finally, we compare our results to citation analysis and discuss how our approach may complement traditional scientometrics. © 2019 The Authors",0,Classification; Document timestamping; Scientometrics; Topic models,Classification (of information); Information analysis; Information retrieval systems; Citation analysis; Contribution analysis; Research and development; Scientific output; Scientometrics; Timestamping; Topic distributions; Topic model; Petroleum reservoir evaluation,"Beel, J., Gipp, B., Langer, S., Breitinger, C., Research-paper recommender systems: A literature survey (2016) International Journal on Digital Libraries, 17 (4), pp. 305-338; Bird, S., Klein, E., Loper, E., Natural language processing with Python: Analyzing text with the natural language toolkit (2009), ” O'Reilly Media, Inc.”; Blei, D., Lafferty, J., Correlated topic models (2006) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 18, p. 147; Blei, D.M., Lafferty, J.D., Dynamic topic models (2006) Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on machine learning ICML ’06, pp. 113-120. , ACM New York, NY, USA; Blei, D.M., Ng, A.Y., Jordan, M.I., Latent Dirichlet allocation (2003) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3 (4-5), pp. 993-1022; Chan, J., Chang, J.C., Hope, T., Shahaf, D., Kittur, A., Solvent: A mixed initiative system for finding analogies between research papers (2018) Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction, 2 (CSCW), pp. 311-31:21; Chang, J., Gerrish, S., Wang, C., Boyd-graber, J.L., Blei, D.M., Reading tea leaves: How humans interpret topic models (2009) Advances in neural information processing systems, 22, pp. 288-296. , Y.

In this paper, we study a bipartite graph connecting authors to publications and extract from it clusters of authors and articles, interpreting the author clusters as research groups and the article clusters as research topics. Visualisations are proposed to ease the interpretation of such clusters in terms of discovering leaders, the activity level, and other semantic aspects. We discuss the process of obtaining and preprocessing the information from scientific publications, the formulation and implementation of the clustering algorithm, and the creation of the visualisations. Experiments on a test data set are presented, using an initial prototype implementation of the proposed modules. © 2015, Springer-Verlag London.",0,Clustering; Collaboration networks; Knowledge discovery; Network analysis,,"Avalos-Gaytán, V., Almendral, J.A., Papo, D., Schaeffer, S.E., Boccaletti, S., Assortative and modular networks are shaped by adaptive synchronization processes (2012) PRE, 86 (1), p. 015101(R); Barber, M.J., Modularity and community detection in bipartite networks (2007) Phys Rev E, 76 (6), p. 066102; Batagelj, V., Efficient algorithms for citation network analysis.

Traditional keyword analyses include the frequency based and the network based methods, both providing efficient mining techniques for identifying the representative keywords. The semantic meanings behind the keywords are important for understanding the research content. However, traditional keyword analysis methods pay scant attention to semantic meanings; the network based or frequency based methods as traditionally used, present limited semantic associations among the keywords. Moreover, the ways in which the semantic meanings behind the keywords are associated to the citations are not clear. Thus, we use the Google Word2Vec model to build word vectors and reduce them to a two-dimensional plane in a Voronoi diagram using the t-SNE algorithm, to link meanings with citations. The distance between semantic meanings of keywords in two-dimensional plane are similar to distances in geographical space, thus we introduce a geographic metaphor, “Ghost City” to describe the relationship between semantics and citations for hot topics that have recently become not so hot. Along with “Ghost City” zones, “Always Hot”, “Newly Emerging Hot”, and “Always Silent” areas are classified and mapped, describing the spatial heterogeneity and homogeneity of the semantic distribution of keywords cited in a domain database. Using a collection of “geographical natural hazard” literature datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method and classification scheme can efficiently provide a unique viewpoint for interpreting the interaction between semantics and the citations, as “Ghost City”, “Always Hot”, “Newly Emerging Hot”, and “Always Silent” areas. © 2017, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",1,Ghost City; Keyword analysis; Semantic space; Spatial analysis; t-SNE; Word2Vec,,"Borgatti, S.P., Everett, M.G., A graph-theoretic perspective on centrality (2006) Social Networks, 28 (4), pp. 466-484; Callon, M., Courtial, J.-P., Turner, W.A., Bauin, S., From translations to problematic networks: An introduction to co-word analysis (1983) Information (International Social Science Council), 22 (2), pp. 191-235; Chen, C., Visualising semantic spaces and author co-citation networks in digital libraries (1999) Information Processing and Management, 35 (3), pp. 401-420; Chen, C., CiteSpace II: Detecting and visualizing emerging trends and transient patterns in scientific literature (2006) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 57 (3), pp. 359-377; Garfield, E., From the science of science to Scientometrics visualizing the history of science with HistCite software (2009) Journal of Informetrics, 3 (3), pp. 173-179; He, Q., Chen, B., Pei, J., Qiu, B., Mitra, P., Giles, C.L., (2009) Detecting topic evolution in scientific literature: How can citations help?

Developing tools to find papers that have the potential to become highly-cited has recently attracted increasing scientific attention. Topics of concern by scholars may change over time in accordance with research trends, resulting in changes in received citations. Author-defined keywords, title and abstract provide valuable information about a research article. This study performs a latent Dirichlet allocation technique to extract topics and keywords from articles; five keyword popularity (KP) features are defined as indicators of emerging trends of articles. Binary classification models are utilized to predict papers that were highly-cited or less highly-cited by a number of supervised learning techniques. We empirically compare KP features of articles with other commonly used journal-related and author-related features proposed in previous studies. The results show that, with KP features, the prediction models are more effective than those with journal and/or author features, especially in the management information system discipline. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.",0,binary classification; highly-cited papers; keyword popularity; supervised learning; topic model,Abstracting; Information management; Statistics; Supervised learning; Academic publications; Binary classification; Emerging trends; Highly-cited papers; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Prediction model; Research trends; Topic Modeling; Learning systems,"Abrishami, A., Aliakbary, S., Predicting citation counts based on deep neural network learning techniques (2019) Journal of Informetrics, 13 (2), pp. 485-499; Acuna, D.E., Allesina, S., Kording, K.P., Future impact: Predicting scientific success (2012) Nature, 489 (7415), p. 201; Bai, X., Zhang, F., Lee, I., Predicting the citations of scholarly paper (2019) Journal of Informetrics, 13 (1), pp. 407-418; Beliakov, G., James, S., Citation-based journal ranks: The use of fuzzy measures (2011) Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 167 (1), pp. 101-119; Blei, D., Ng, A., Jordan, M., Latent dirichlet allocation (2003) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3, pp. 993-1022; Bornmann, L., Leydesdorff, L., Wang, J., How to improve the prediction based on citation impact percentiles for years shortly after the publication date?

This study aims to capture the scientific structure and topic evolution of big data research using bibliometrics and text mining-based analysis methods. Bibliographic data of journal articles regarding big data published between 2009 to 2018 were collected from the Scopus database and analyzed. The results show a significant growth of publications since 2014. Furthermore, the findings of this study highlight the core journals, most cited articles, top productive authors, countries, and institutions. Secondly, a unique approach to identifying and analyzing major research themes in big data publications was proposed. Keywords were clustered, and each cluster was labeled as a theme. Moreover, the papers were divided into four sub-periods to observe the thematic evolution. The theme mapping reveals that research on big data is dominated by big data analytics, which covers methods, tools, supporting infrastructure, and applications. Other critical aspects of big data research are security and privacy. Social networks and the Internet of things are significant sources of big data, and the resources and services offered by cloud computing strongly support the management and processing of big data. © 2020 by the authors.",1,Bibliometrics; Big data; Clustering; Science mapping; Text mining,Big data; Data Analytics; Data handling; Mapping; Social computing; Social sciences computing; Text mining; Analysis method; Bibliographic data; Bibliometrics; Bibliometrics analysis; Clustering; Data publications; Journal articles; Security and privacy; Information management,"van Rijmenam, M., (2019) A Short History of Big Data, , https://datafloq.com/read/big-data-history/239, (accessed on 30 October 2019); Chen, M., Mao, S., Zhang, Y., Leung, V.C.M., (2014) Big Data: Related Technologies, Challenges and Future Prospects;, , Springer: Berlin/Heidelberg, Germany; (2018) Is the Hype Around Big Data Nothing But Hype, , https://www.datameer.com/blog/big-data-hype-real-stay/, (accessed on 25 October 2019); Zgurovsky, M.Z., Zaychenko, Y.P., (2020) Big Data: Conceptual Analysis and Applications;, , Springer: Berlin/Heidelberg, Germany; Gantz, B.J., Reinsel, D., Shadows, B.D., (2012) Big Data, Bigger Digital Shadows, and Biggest Growth in the Far East Executive Summary: A Universe of Opportunities and Challenges;, 2007, pp. 1-16. , IDC: Framingham, MA, USA; James, J., Data Never Sleeps 7 (2019) Domosphere, , https://www.domo.com/learn/data-never-sleeps-7, (accessed on 27 October 2019); Hu, H., Wen, Y., Chua, T.-S., Li, X., Toward Scalable Systems for Big Data Analytics: A Technology Tutorial (2014) IEEE Access, 2, pp. 652-687; Gatz, J., Reinsel, D., Extracting Value from Chaos (2011) IDC iview, 2011 (1142), pp. 1-12; Laney, D., 3D Data Management: Controlling Data Volume, Velocity, and Variety. 2001 (2001) Gartner.

Existing methods of interdisciplinary topic identification have their respective application fields, and each identification result can help researchers acquire partial characteristics of interdisciplinary topics. This paper offers an integrated method for identifying and predicting interdisciplinary topics from scientific literature. It integrates various methods, including co-occurrence networks analysis, high-TI terms analysis and burst detection, and offers an overall perspective into interdisciplinary topic identification. The results of the different methods are mutually confirmed and complemented, further overviewing the characteristics of the interdisciplinary field and highlighting the importance or potential of interdisciplinary topics. In this study, Information Science and Library Science is selected as a case study. The research has clearly shown that more accurate and comprehensive results can be achieved for interdisciplinary topic identification and prediction by employing this integrated method. Further, the integration of different methods has promising potential for application in knowledge discovery and scientific measurement in the future. © 2018, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",1,Information science and library science; Integrated method; Interdisciplinary topic; Topic identification,,"Breunig, M.M., LOF: Identifying density-based local outliers (2000) In ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, 29, pp. 93-104. , May 16–18, 2000, Dallas, TX, USA, DBLP; Callon, M., Courtial, J.P., Laville, F., Co-word analysis as a tool for describing the network of interactions between basic and technological research: The case of polymer chemsitry (1991) Scientometrics, 22 (1), pp. 155-205; Callon, M., Courtial, J.J.P., Turner, W.A., Bauin, S., From translations to problematic networks—An introduction to co-word analysis (1983) Social Science Information, 22 (2), pp. 191-235; Chawla, S., Sun, P., Slom: A new measure for local spatial outliers (2006) Knowledge and Information Systems, 9 (4), pp. 412-429; Chu, J., Qian, Q., Analysis of research focus and research methods in the field of knowledge management during the past decade (2014) Information Science, 10, pp. 156-160; Freeman, L.C., A set of measures of centrality based on betweenness (1977) Sociometry, 40 (1), pp. 35-41; Garfield, E., Historiographic mapping of knowledge domains literature (2004) Journal of Information Science, 30 (2), pp. 119-145; Hawkins, D.M., Identification of outliers (1980) Biometrics, 37 (4), p. 860; Hong, S., Lin, J., Zhang, Y., Density-based outlier detection on uncertain data (2015) Computer Science, 42 (5), pp. 230-233; Kleinberg, J., Bursty and hierarchical structure in streams (2003) In Eighth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 7, pp. 91-101. , ACM; Li, X., Research hotspots and trend analysis of railway transportation engineering management based on knowledge graph (2017) Rail Way Transport and Economy, 1, pp. 81-87; Li, C., Liu, F., Guo, F., Analysis on interdisciplinary research topics with cinder of overlapping communities visualization software: Taking the information science and computer science for example (2013) Library and Information Service, 7, pp. 75-80; Mane, K.K., Börner, K., Mapping topics and topic bursts in pnas (2004) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 101, pp. 5287-5290; Min, C., Sun, J., Clustering analysis on discipline-crossing research hotspots: An example of library and information science and journalism and communication studies (2014) Library and Information Service, 58 (1), pp. 109-116; Papadimitriou, S., Kitagawa, H., Gibbons, P.B., Faloutsos, C., LOCI: Fast outlier detection using the local correlation integral (2003) In: Data Engineering, 2003.

We use this case to examine drawbacks for the defense when the presentation of scientific evidence is partial, especially when the only perspective mentioned is that of the prosecution. We tackle this discussion at two distinct levels. First, we pursue an essentially non-technical presentation of the topic by drawing parallels between the court's summing up of the case and flawed patterns of reasoning commonly seen in other forensic disciplines, such as DNA and particle traces (e.g., gunshot residues). Then, we propose a formal analysis of the case, using elements of probability and graphical probability models, to justify our main claim that the partial presentation of digital evidence poses a risk to the administration of justice in that it keeps vital information from the defense. We will argue that such practice constitutes a violation of general principles of forensic interpretation as established by forensic science literature and current recommendations by forensic science interest groups (e.g., the European Network of Forensic Science Institutes). Finally, we posit that argument construction and analysis using formal methods can help replace digital evidence appropriately into context and thus support a sound evaluation of the evidence. © 2016 The Authors.

Taking up now the objectives of evaluative scientometrics, we attempt to link the textual analysis of small sets of individual scientific papers to evaluative bibliometrics. The objective is, however, quite similar. We focus on the detection of similarities and on monitoring structural changes but this time on the small scale. We proceed from earlier approaches used in quantitative linguistics applied to bibliometrics (Telcs et al. in Math Soc Sci; 10(2):169–178, 1985). In the present pilot study we have selected 18 papers by András Schubert and published in three different periods with 6 papers each: 1983–1985, 1993–1998 and 2010–2013. The objective is twofold: We first try only to detect linguistic regularities in the scientometric text by applying a Waring model to the analysis of Schubert’s vocabulary on the basis of all words and nouns. The second goal refers to the identification of changes in the used vocabulary over a period of three decades. The main findings are discussed along with future research tasks, which arise from these result in the context of the analysis of dynamics and emergence of research topics at the micro and nano level. © 2017, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",1,Nano-level analysis; Natural language processing; Quantitative linguistics; Waring distribution; Word-frequency,,"Braun, T., Schubert, A., Schubert, G., On the molecular structure of the co-author network of Alexandru T.

Any structure, whether mechanical or aeronautical, before being put into use undergoes a structural integrity assessment and testing. In this case, non-destructive evaluations are performed, aiming to estimate the degree of safety and reliability of the structure. For this, there are techniques traditionally used such as ultrasonic inspection, X-ray, acoustic emission tests, among other techniques. The traditional techniques may even have a good instrumental apparatus and be well formulated for structural integrity assessment; however, these techniques cannot meet growing industrial needs, even more so when structures are in motion. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate artificial immune systems (AISs), ate and strengthen the emergence of an innovative technological tool, the biological immune systems and AISs, and these are presented as computing methods in the field of structural health monitoring (SHM). Design/methodology/approach: The concept of SHM is based on a fault detection mechanism used in industries, and in other applications, involving the observation of a structure or a mechanical system. This observation occurs through the dynamic response of periodic measurements, later related to the statistical analysis, determining the integrity of the system. This study aims to develop a methodology that identifies and classifies a signal in normal signals or in faults, using an algorithm based on artificial immunological systems, being the negative selection algorithm, and later, this algorithm classifies the failures in probabilities of failure and degree of fault severity. The results demonstrate that the proposed SHM is efficient and robust for prognosis and failure detection. Findings: The present study aims to develop different fast access methodologies for the prognosis and detection of failures, classifying and judging the types of failures based on AISs. The authors declare that the present study was neither published in any other vehicle of scientific information nor is under consideration for publication in another scientific journal, and that this paper strictly followed the ethical procedures of research and publication as requested. Originality/value: This study is original by the fact that conventional structural integrity monitoring methods need improvements, which intelligent computing techniques can satisfy. Intelligent techniques are tools inspired by natural and/or biological processes and belong to the field of computational intelligence. They present good results in problems of pattern recognition and diagnosis and thus can be adapted to solve problems of monitoring and identifying structural failures in mechanical and aeronautical engineering. Thus, the proposal of this study demonstrates and strengthens the emergence of an innovative technological tool, the biological immune system and the AIS, and these are presented as computation methods in the field of SHM in rotating systems – a topic not yet addressed in the literature. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",0,Artificial immune systems; Negative selection algorithm; Structural health monitoring,Acoustic emission testing; Automatic identification; Disaster prevention; Dynamics; Fault detection; Fracture mechanics; Immune system; Intelligent computing; Losses; Machine design; Pattern recognition; Structural health monitoring; Structural integrity; Ultrasonic testing; Artificial Immune System; Design/methodology/approach; Fault-detection mechanisms; Negative selection algorithm; Non destructive evaluation; Research and technological development; Structural health monitoring (SHM); Structural integrity assessment; Failure (mechanical),"Adams, J.R.M.L., (2010) Rotating Machinery Vibration: From Analysis to Troubleshooting, p. 478. , p., CRC Press, Broken Sound Parkway; Bradley, D.W., Tyrrell, A.M., Immunotronics – novel finite-state-machine architectures with built-in self-test using self-nonself differentiation (2002) IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6 (3), pp. 227-238; Chen, Y., Li, Y., (2018) Computational Intelligence Assisted Design in Industrial Revolution 4.0, p. 527. , p., CRC Press, Boca Raton; Chilengue, Z., Dente, J.A., Costa Branco, P.J., An artificial immune system approach for fault detection in the stator and rotor circuits of induction machines (2011) Electric Power Systems Research, 81 (1), pp. 158-169; Choi, B.K., Yang, B.Y., Optimal design of rotor-bearing systems using immune-genetic algorithm (2001) Journal of Vibration and Acoustics, 123 (3), pp. 398-401; Dasgupta, D., Niño, L.F., (2009) Immunological Computation: Theory and Applications, p. 298. , p., Taylor and Francis Group, Boca Raton; De Castro, L.N., Timmis, J., Artificial immune systems as a novel soft computing paradigm (2003) Soft Computing Journal, 7 (8), pp. 526-544; Deraemaeker, A., Worden, K., (2010) New Trends in Vibration Based Structural Health Monitoring, p. 311. , p., SpringerWien, NewYork; Farrar, C.R., Worden, K., (2013) Structural Health Monitoring: A Machine Learning Perspective, p. 643. , p., John Wiley, Chichester; Forrest, S., Perelson, A.S., Allen, L., Cherukuri, R., Self-nonself discrimination in a computer (1994) Proceeding of the IEEE Symposium on Research in Security and Privacy, pp. 202-212. , Oakland; Gopalakrishnan, S., Ruzzene, M., Hanagud, S., (2011) Computational Techniques for Structural Health Monitoring, p. 517. , p., Springer-Verlag, London; Gulati, R., (2013) Maintenance and Reliability Best Practices, p. 495. , p., Industrial Press, New York, NY; Ilhan, A., Mehmet, K., Ebru, K., Erhan, A., A new fault diagnosis approach for induction motor using negative selection algorithm and its real-time implementation on FPGA (2018) Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems, 34 (1), pp. 689-701; Lima, F.P.A., Chavarette, F.R., Souza, A.S.E., Souza, S.S.F., Opes, M.L.M., Artificial immune systems with negative selection applied to health monitoring of aeronautical structures (2013) Advanced Materials Research, 871, pp. 283-289; Osire, S.E., Gonçalves, A.P., Alemayehu, F.M., (2017) Probabilistic Prognostics and Health Management of Energy Systems,Gewerbestrasse, p. 273. , p., Springer International Publishing; Parhi, D.R., Sahu, S., Clonal fuzzy intelligent system for fault diagnosis of cracked beam (2018) International Journal of Damage Mechanics, 27 (6), pp. 840-858; Popkova, E.G., Ragulina, Y.V., Bogoviz, A.V., (2019) Industry 4.0: Industrial Revolution of the 21st Century, p. 249. , p., Springer International; Sotiropoulos, D.N., Tsihrintzis, G.A., (2017) Machine Learning Paradigms: Artificial Immune Systems and Their Applications in Software Personalization, p. 336. , p., Springer International Publishing, Switzerland; Syahputra, R., Soesanti, I., Power system stabilizer model using artificial immune system for power system controlling (2016) International Journal of Applied Engineering Research, 18 (11), pp. 9269-9278; Tan, Y., (2016) Artificial Immune System: Applications in Computer Security, p. 205. , p., JohnWiley& Sons, Hoboken; Vance, J., Zeidan, F., Murphy, B., (2010) Machinery Vibration and Rotordynamics, p. 419. , p., John Wiley and Sons, New Jersey; Yoon, S.Y., Lin, Z., Allaire, P.E., (2013) Control of Surge in Centrifugal Compressors by Active Magnetic Bearings, Theory and Implementation, p. 292. , p., Springer, London","Mishra, V.N.; Department of Mathematics, India; email: vishnunarayanmishra@gmail.com",,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,2644401,,ENCOE,,English,Eng.

Identification of related scientific articles based on keywords and abstracts help researchers to find desired and informative content, but it requires the utilization of variety of text analytics (mining) methods to address the need. This study investigates information systems (IS) articles to cluster and evaluate the domain of knowledge of recent Information Systems publications using text clustering methods, and then to predict the exact clusters of knowledge of new articles using classification methods. This categorization and predictive learning approach help the scholars and practitioners to find the most relevant articles for their researches and practical endeavors through an automated mechanism. Articles have been collected from the Scopus repository. The dataset has been narrowed to specific areas of recent information systems research. Different text analytics methods such as text normalization, natural language processing (NLP) and clustering algorithms have been applied and the results for each cluster are evaluated by extensive analysis of identified clusters based on their terms frequency and key phrases. Afterwards, different classification algorithms are applied to learn the current clustering and to predict the major subject focus of a newly published article based on the abstract approximation to the previously learned domains of information systems knowledge. The prediction approach helps the scholars identifying the usability of many articles for further research. © 2017, Babak Sohrabi, Iman Raeesi Vanani and Mohsen Baranizade Shineh.",1,Document classification; Information systems; Natural language processing (NLP); Text analytics; Text clustering,,"Aggarwal, C.C., Zhai, C.X., A survey of text clustering algorithms C.

While there are several repositories that curate public datasets, several more datasets and their usage is hidden in the research publications. Hence, discovering a relevant dataset for a research topic requires in-depth investigation of several publications, tracking dataset usage and in-exhaustive literature search. To this end, a search engine to directly handle the research dataset discovery problem is extremely useful for the scientific community. In this work, we define an important paradigm of dataset search known as dataset discovery in application context. Unlike dataset look-up type search where the user looks up for dataset in a repository, application context based search corresponds to search without information about the name of the dataset. Such searches arise when the user is looking a best fit dataset for his research problem. We show that in this paradigm of search, conventional methods of indexing the little text about the dataset description do not work due to lack of application text content within the description text for a dataset. To alleviate this problem we propose two models of search, namely, (1) a user profile based search and (2) a keyword based search. We show that in both these models the dataset discovery is done in the application context by leveraging information from open source web resources such as scholarly articles repositories and academic search engines. The performance of the proposed models were tested with simulated test queries (user profiles) as well as with real world user studies. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

However, contributions to the systematic mapping of this field continue to be lacking. This paper constitutes the first bibliometric study in this field to better understand the current state of research. We examined 481 records from databases Scopus and Web of Science (Core Collection) using several bibliometric analysis methods. All the records on this emerging topic were published between 2011 and 2019. We processed these records using statistical analysis and science mapping. The bibliometric analysis included the year of publication, journal name, citation, author, country, and particularly, research methodology. Additionally, we used the VOSViewer software to perform bibliometric mapping of co-authorship, co-citation of authors, and co-occurrence of keywords. This field of study, it was found, is currently in its precursor stage, contributing primarily to the fields of medicine, computer science, and health sciences. The United States appeared to have made the largest contribution to this field. However, author productivity, number of citations, and number of core journals all indicated a high degree of fragmentation of research in this filed. Remarkably, scientific research in this area is expected to progress tremendously over time. Overall, this study provides basic data and research classifications for the initial phase of research and research direction for future research in this area. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",0,Bibliometric study; Fitness app; Mapping; mHealth,Mapping; Bibliometric analysis; Emerging topics; Health science; Research methodologies; Scientific researches; State of research; Systematic mapping; Web of Science; Health,"Adhikari, R., Richards, D., Scott, K., Security and privacy issues related to the use of mobile health apps (2014), Proceedings of the 25th Australasian Conference on Information Systems.

Moreover, a new ensemble method for an automatic topic extraction (TE) has been proposed in this paper, from a set of scientific publications in the form of text documents with the purpose of extracting topics from clustered documents. Often, the existing TE methods draw upon the statistical theory. However, the results might be different when the same clustered document is utilized. Consequently, there can be imprecise results, which are related to the extracted topics from the clustered documents owing to the behavior of the TE methods. As a result, the vigorous characteristics of the TE methods are ensembled, thereby empowering the accuracy of the extracted topics. The results, which were yielded by H-MVO for TDC, were compared against 14 well-regarded methods, involving five clustering methods, in addition to seven metaheuristic algorithms, as well as two hybrid optimization algorithms. Also, the results, which were generated by the introduced ensembled TE method, were compared against those, which were produced by five established statistical methods in the literature. As a result, the findings revealed that the suggested ensembled TE method outperformed the entire comparative methods, thereby utilizing all the external measurements for almost the entire datasets. Moreover, the new method can complement the advantages of the five previously proposed methods. Accordingly, more advanced results were obtained. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",1,Ensemble method; Hybridization; K-means; Multi-verse optimizer; Scientific publications clustering; Topic extraction,Cluster analysis; Data mining; Optimization; Text processing; Clustering methods; Comparative methods; Hybrid optimization algorithm; Meta heuristic algorithm; Scientific publications; Statistical theory; Text Document Clustering; Topic extraction; K-means clustering,"Abasi, A.K., Khader, A.T., Al-Betar, M.A., Naim, S., Makhadmeh, S.N., Alyasseri, Z.A.A., An improved text feature selection for clustering using binary grey wolf optimizer (2019) Proceedings of the 11Th National Technical Seminar on Unmanned System Technology 2019, pp. 503-516. , Springer; Abasi, A.K., Khader, A.T., Al-Betar, M.A., Naim, S., Makhadmeh, S.N., Alyasseri, Z.A.A., A text feature selection technique based on binary multi-verse optimizer for text clustering (2019) 2019 IEEE Jordan International Joint Conference on Electrical Engineering and Information Technology (JEEIT), pp. 1-6. , IEEE; Abasi, A.K., Khader, A.T., Al-Betar, M.A., Naim, S., Alyasseri, Z.A.A., Makhadmeh, S.N., A novel hybrid multi-verse optimizer with k-means for text documents clustering (2020) Neural Comput Appl, , (, a,),.,., https://doi.org/10.1007/s00521-020-04945-0; Abasi, A.K., Khader, A.T., Al-Betar, M.A., Naim, S., Makhadmeh, S.N., Alyasseri, Z.A.A., Link-based multi-verse optimizer for text documents clustering (2020) Appl Soft Comput, 87, p. 106002; Aljarah, I., Mafarja, M., Heidari, A.A., Faris, H., Mirjalili, S., Multi-verse optimizer: theory, literature review, and application in data clustering (2020) Nature-inspired optimizers, pp. 123-141. , Springer, Berlin; Alyasseri, Z.A.A., Khadeer, A.T., Al-Betar, M.A., Abasi, A., Makhadmeh, S., Ali, N.S., The effects of eeg feature extraction using multi-wavelet decomposition for mental tasks classification (2019) Proceedings of the International Conference on Information and Communication Technology, pp. 139-146; Alyasseri, Z.A.A., Khader, A.T., Al-Betar, M.A., Abasi, A.K., Makhadmeh, S.N., EEG signals denoising using optimal wavelet transform hybridized with efficient metaheuristic methods (2019) IEEE Access, 8, pp. 10584-10605; Arthur, D., Vassilvitskii, S., K-means++: The advantages of careful seeding (2007) Proceedings of the Eighteenth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms.

Methods A graph network was constructed from the publicly available COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) of COVID-19-related publications using an engine leveraging medical knowledge bases to identify discrete medical concepts and an open-source tool (Gephi) to visualise the network. Results The network shows connections between diseases, medications and procedures identified from the title and abstract of 195 958 COVID-19-related publications (CORD-19 Dataset). Connections between terms with few publications, those unconnected to the main network and those irrelevant were not displayed. Nodes were coloured by knowledge base and the size of the node related to the number of publications containing the term. The data set and visualisations were made publicly accessible via a webtool. Conclusion Knowledge management approaches (text mining and graph networks) can effectively allow rapid navigation and exploration of entity inter-relationships to improve understanding of diseases such as COVID-19. ©",0,BMJ health informatics; health care; information science; medical informatics,artificial intelligence; epidemiology; human; knowledge discovery; natural language processing; procedures; publication; Artificial Intelligence; COVID-19; Humans; Knowledge Discovery; Natural Language Processing; Periodicals as Topic; SARS-CoV-2,"Kambhampati, S.B.S., Vaishya, R., Vaish, A., Unprecedented surge in publications related to COVID-19 in the first three months of pandemic: A bibliometric analytic report (2020) J Clin Orthop Trauma, 11, pp. S304-S306; (2019) Coronavirus Disease, , https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019, [Accessed 3 May 2020]; Zyoud Sa'Ed, H., Al-Jabi, S.W., Mapping the situation of research on coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19): A preliminary bibliometric analysis during the early stage of the outbreak (2020) BMC Infect Dis, 20, p. 561; Liu, N., Chee, M.L., Niu, C., Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): An evidence map of medical literature (2020) BMC Med Res Methodol, 20, p. 177; Albahri, A.S., Hamid, R.A., Alwan, J.K., Role of biological data mining and machine learning techniques in detecting and diagnosing the novel coronavirus (COVID-19): A systematic review (2020) J Med Syst, 44, p. 122; Brainard, J., Scientists are drowning in COVID-19 papers.

Skłodowska-Curie St., Zabrze, 41-819, Poland","Aerosol water is a master component of atmospheric aerosols and a medium that enables all aqueous-phase reactions occurring in the atmosphere. This integral chemical compound of suspended aerosol particles (PM) has become one of the hottest issues in recent years. To look for scientific productivity in the area of PM-bound water research a bibliometric analysis was performed. Most actual literature regarding aerosol and particulate bound water and implications of the research in this field was downloaded from WOS database using 1996–2018 timespan. Different bibliographic statistics were used to get a general profile of leading authorships, institutions, countries and mainstream journals providing most highly cited articles in the field. Using the CiteSpace software it was possible to identify past trends and possible future directions in measuring aerosol bound water. The search terms used in the database were {“aerosol” AND “water” OR “chemical mass balance”} AND {“particulate matter” OR “PM-bound water” OR “hygroscopic”}. The answers to the following questions were found: which authors, countries, institutions and aerosol journals to the greatest degree influenced PM-bound water research?. The network of co-occurring noun phrases was extracted from the set of publications, followed by co-citation analysis. The network was also clustered by top terms which gave a clear picture of topics most often undertaken. Finally the publication meeting eligibility criteria were looked for chemical compounds most frequently determined in PM-bound water research, which help to indicate works where quantitative assessment of PM-bound water was performed. Obtained results indicate that the paper with the greatest citation burst was Tang and Munkelwitz (J Geophys Res Atmos 99(D9):18801–18808, 1994). The largest number of articles in this specific field was published in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics. An absolute leader in the quantity of publications among all research institutions is National Aeronautics Space Administration NASA. Meteorology and Atmospheric sciences is the discipline most occupied by highly cited journals in this field. Clustering results indicate that the research has mainly focused on hygroscopic measurement of aerosol, hygroscopic growth of particles; aerosol liquid water, and hygroscopic behavior. Most articles rather points PM-bound water as an artifact in organic carbon and ions measurements without detailed analysis of its contents or probable origin. The number of publications in each cluster of the build network is relatively high, which indicate that scholars have formed a rather consistent studies in the theme of aerosol-bound water. Despite a relevant role played by aerosol-bound water in atmospheric processes a quantitative description of its contents is rather rarely found in the literature (with the total number of only 23 papers concerning PM-bound water contents). In terms of yield, USA, China and Italy ranked highest, playing a propelling role in the research on PM-bound water. Future trends in PM-bound water research should be directed to a quantitative measurements of its contents; source apportionment, chemical composition of PM—modulating its hygroscopicity and therefore cloud formation processes, and the assessment of artefacts influencing the quality of PM-bound water measurements. Those areas should be especially developed in future studies and scientific projects concerning atmospheric water. © 2020, The Author(s).",0,Atmospheric water; CiteSpace; Knowledge domain; PM hygroscopicity; PM-bound water; Systematic review,,"Andrews, E., Larson, S.M., Effect of surfactant layers on the size changes of aerosol-particles as a function of relative humidity (1993) Environmental Science and Technology, 27 (5), pp. 857-865; Balasubramanian, R., Comprehensive characterization of PM2.5 aerosols in Singapore (2003) Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmospheres, 108 (D16), p. 17; Bardouki, H., Chemical composition of size-resolved atmospheric aerosols in the eastern Mediterranean during summer and winter (2003) Atmospheric Environment, 37 (2), pp. 195-208; Berg, O.H., Hygroscopic growth of aerosol particles in the marine boundary layer over the Pacific and Southern Oceans during the first aerosol characterization experiment (ACE 1) (1998) Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmospheres, 103 (D13), pp. 16535-16545; Bharti, S.K., Characterization and morphological analysis of individual aerosol of PM10 in urban area of Lucknow, India (2017) Micron, 103, pp. 90-98; Brown, A.S., Studies of the effect of humidity and other factors on some different filter materials used for gravimetric measurements of ambient particulate matter (2006) Atmospheric Environment, 40 (25), pp. 4670-4678; Canepari, S., Qualitative and quantitative determination of water in airborne particulate matter (2013) Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, 13 (3), pp. 1193-1202; Canepari, S., Mass size distribution of particle-bound water (2017) Atmospheric Environment, 165, pp. 46-56; Casati, M., Experimental measurements of particulate matter deliquescence and crystallization relative humidity: Application in heritage climatology (2015) Aerosol and Air Quality Research, 15 (2), pp. 399-409; Charlson, R.J., Climate Forcing by anthropogenic aerosols (1992) Science, 255 (5043), pp. 423-430; Chen, C., (2013) Mapping scientific frontiers: The quest for knowledge visualization, , 2, Springer, Berlin; Chen, C., (2016) CiteSpace: A practical guide for mapping scientific literature, , Nova Sciene Publishers, Hauppauge; Chen, C.M., The structure and dynamics of cocitation clusters: A multiple-perspective cocitation analysis (2010) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 61 (7), pp. 1386-1409; Chen, J.J., Source apportionment of visual impairment during the California regional PM10/PM2.5 air quality study (2009) Atmospheric Environment, 43 (39), pp. 6136-6144; Cheng, Y.F., Reactive nitrogen chemistry in aerosol water as a source of sulfate during haze events in China (2016) Science Advances, 2 (12); Covert, D.S., Heintzenberg, J., Size distribution and chemical properties of aerosol at NY Alesund, Svalbard (1993) Atmospheric Environment Part A—General Topics, 27 (17-18), pp. 2989-2997; Cropper, P.M., Measurement of light scattering in an urban area with a nephelometer and PM2.5 FDMS TEOM monitor: Accounting for the effect of water (2013) Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association, 63 (9), pp. 1004-1011; Cropper, P.M., Use of a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry organic aerosol monitor for in-field detection of fine particulate organic compounds in source apportionment (2018) Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association, 68 (5), pp. 390-402; D’Angelo, L., Seasonal behavior of PM2.5 deliquescence, crystallization, and hygroscopic growth in the Po Valley (Milan): Implications for remote sensing applications (2016) Atmospheric Research, 176, pp. 87-95; Decesari, S., Chemical features and seasonal variation of fine aerosol water-soluble organic compounds in the Po Valley, Italy (2001) Atmospheric Environment, 35 (21), pp. 3691-3699; Duan, F.K., Concentration and chemical characteristics of PM2.5 in Beijing, China: 2001–2002 (2006) Science of the Total Environment, 355 (1-3), pp. 264-275; Duplissy, J., Relating hygroscopicity and composition of organic aerosol particulate matter (2011) Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, 11 (3), pp. 1155-1165; Eatough, D.J., Fine particulate chemical composition and light extinction at Canyonlands National Park using organic particulate material concentrations obtained with a multisystem, multichannel diffusion denuder sampler (1996) Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmospheres, 101 (D14), pp. 19515-19531; El-Sayed, M.M.H., The effects of isoprene and NOx on secondary organic aerosols formed through reversible and irreversible uptake to aerosol water (2018) Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, 18 (2), pp. 1171-1184; (2003) Model Performance for Particulate Matter.

This study proposes a topic analysis method combining latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and a three-dimensional strategic diagram. This study constructs the three-dimensional strategic diagram by three dimensions of centrality, density and novelty, and we classify topics into seven categories according to their strategic positions. Using this topic analysis method, the paper analyses 62,340 publications in the field of medical informatics between 1991 and 2018. Results show that the research scope of medical informatics has become increasingly interdisciplinary. Data analytical methods and technologies are sub-domains with persistent popularity. New health technologies, drug safety, algorithm optimisation and standardisation of medical information are emerging research topics. We hope the findings could help researchers identify potential research topics and facilitate in-depth analysis of the current state of various fields. © The Author(s) 2020.",1,Latent Dirichlet allocation; medical informatics; three-dimensional strategic diagram; topic analysis,Statistics; Analytical method; Health technology; In-depth analysis; Latent dirichlet allocations; Medical information; Potential researches; Scientific literature; Three dimensions; Medical informatics,"Larsen, P.O., Ins, M.V., The rate of growth in scientific publication and the decline in coverage provided by Science Citation Index (2010) Scientometrics, 84 (3), pp. 575-603; Boyack, K.W., Klavans, R., Creation of a highly detailed, dynamic, global model and map of science (2014) J Am Soc Inf Sci Technol, 65 (4), pp. 670-685; Li, H., Yamanishi, K., Topic analysis using a finite mixture model (2003) Inf Process Manage, 39 (4), pp. 521-541; Pussep, A., Schief, M., Schmidt, B., Topics in software industry transformation research: a topic analysis of major IS conferences, pp. 128-140. , 3rd international conference on software business (ICSOB), Cambridge, MA, 18–20 June 2012, Berlin, Springer-Verlag, In; Ubeda-Sanchez, A.M., Fernandez-Cano, A., Callejas, Z., Inferring hot topics and emerging educational research fronts (2019) On Horiz, 27 (2), pp. 125-134; Natale, F., Fiore, G., Hofherr, J., Mapping the research on aquaculture.

However, a series of early and recent studies demonstrate the existence of indirect and continuous citation impact across generations. Adding to the literature on high-order citations, we introduce the concept of a citation cascade: the constitution of a series of subsequent citing events initiated by a certain publication. We investigate this citation structure by analyzing more than 450,000 articles and over 6 million citation relations. We show that citation impact exists not only within the three generations documented in prior research but also in much further generations. Still, our experimental results indicate that two to four generations are generally adequate to trace a work's scientific impact. We also explore specific structural properties—such as depth, width, structural virality, and size—which account for differences among individual citation cascades. Finally, we find evidence that it is more important for a scientific work to inspire trans-domain (or indirectly related domain) works than to receive only intradomain recognition in order to achieve high impact. Our methods and findings can serve as a new tool for scientific evaluation and the modeling of scientific history. © 2020 Association for Information Science and Technology",0,,Citation analysis; Citation impact; High impact; Intra-domain; Quantitative study; Scientific evaluations; Three generations; Topic relevance; Information analysis; article,"Anderson, A., Huttenlocher, D., Kleinberg, J., Leskovec, J., Tiwari, M., (2015), pp. 66-76. , .

This study evaluates the use of three different reproducible approaches for identifying the emergence of technological novelties in scientific publications. The selected approaches are term counting technique, the emergence score (EScore) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We found that the methods provide somewhat distinct perspectives on technological.The term count based method identifies detailed emergence patterns. EScore is a complex bibliometric indicator that provides a holistic view of emergence by considering several parameters, namely term frequency, size, and origin of the research community. LDA traces emergence at the thematic level and provides insights on the linkages between emerging research topics. The results suggest that term counting produces results practical for operational purposes, while LDA offers insight at a strategic level. © 2019, The Author(s).",0,Emergence score (EScore); Technological emergence; Text analytics; Topic modeling,,"Adner, R., Levinthal, D.A., The emergence of emerging technologies (2002) California Management Review, 45 (1), p. 50; Arun, R., Suresh, V., Madhavan, C.V., Murthy, M.N., (2010) In Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 391-402. , Berlin, Springer; Ayres, R., (1969) Technological forecasting and long-range planning, , McGraw-Hill, New York; Bez, R., Camerlenghi, E., Modelli, A., Visconti, A., Introduction to flash memory (2003) Proceedings of the IEEE, 91 (4), p. 489; Bhadade, A., Mehta, P., Kanade, S., Nataraj, G., Utility of light-emitting diode microscopy for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV infected patients (2015) International Journal of Mycobacteriology, 4 (1), p. 31; Bhatti, S., Sbiaa, R., Hirohata, A., Ohno, H., Fukami, S., Piramanayagam, S., Spintronics based random access memory: A review (2017) Materials Today, 20, pp. 530-548; Blei, D.M., Ng, A.Y., Jordan, M.I., Lafferty, J., Latent dirichlet allocation (2003) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3, p. 2003; Boyack, K.W., Newman, D., Duhon, R.J., Klavans, R., Patek, M., Biberstine, J.R., Clustering more than two million biomedical publications: Comparing the accuracies of nine text-based similarity approaches (2011) PLoS ONE, 6 (3); Breitzman, A., Thomas, P., The emerging clusters model: A tool for identifying emerging technologies across multiple patent systems (2015) Research Policy, 44 (1), p. 195; Cai, Y., Haratsch, E.F., Mutlu, O., Mai, K., Threshold voltage distribution in MLC NAND flash memory: Characterization, analysis, and modeling (2013) Design Automation Test in Europe Conference Exhibition, pp. 1285-1290; Carley, S., Newman, N., Porter, A., Garner, J., An indicator of technical emergence (2018) Scientometrics, 115, p. 35; Chang, J., Gerrish, S., Wang, C., Reading tea leaves: How humans interpret topic models (2009) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems; Chang, T.C., Chang, K.C., Tsai, T.M., Chu, T.J., Sze, S.M., Resistance random access memory (2016) Materials Today, 19 (5), p. 254; Chang, T.C., Jian, F.Y., Chen, S.C., Tsai, Y.T., Developments in nanocrystal memory (2011) Materials Today, 14 (12), p. 608; Cole, B., Flash-theres more than one road to dense nonvolatile memory (1988) Electronics, 61 (18), p. 108; Craford, M.G., Overview of device issues in high-brightness light-emitting diodes (1997) Semiconductors and Semimetals, 48, p. 47; Criscuolo, P., Verspagen, B., Does it matter where patent citations come from?

In a traditional approach, the paper collection is first divided into temporal subsets, and then a co-word network is independently depicted in a 2D map to characterize each period’s trend. To effectively map emerging research trends from such a time-series of co-word networks, this paper presents TrendNets, a novel visualization methodology that highlights the rapid changes in edge weights over time. Specifically, we formulated a new convex optimization framework that decomposes the matrix constructed from dynamic co-word networks into a smooth part and a sparse part: the former represents stationary research topics, while the latter corresponds to bursty research topics. Simulation results on synthetic data demonstrated that our matrix decomposition approach achieved the best burst detection performance over four baseline methods. In experiments conducted using papers published in the past 16 years at three conferences in different fields, we showed the effectiveness of TrendNets compared to the traditional co-word representation. We have made our codes available on the Web to encourage scientific mapping in all research fields. © 2019, The Author(s).",0,Burst detection; Dynamic co-word networks; Emerging research trends; Science mapping,,"Assefa, S.G., Rorissa, A., A bibliometric mapping of the structure of STEM education using co-word analysis (2013) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 64 (12), pp. 2513-2536; Beck, A., Teboulle, M., A fast iterative shrinkage–thresholding algorithm for linear inverse problems (2009) SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences, 2, pp. 183-202; Blei, D.M., Lafferty, J.D., Dynamic topic models (2006) In Proceedings of International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), pp. 113-120; Blei, D.M., Ng, A.Y., Jordan, M.I., Latent Dirichlet allocation (2003) The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3, pp. 993-1022; Blondel, V.D., Guillaume, J.-L., Lambiotte, R., Lefebvre, E., Fast unfolding of communities in large networks (2008) Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment, 10, p.

With the spread of these systems in various fields, studies show the need for more attention to applying them in scientific applications. Applying recommender systems to scientific domain, such as paper recommendation, expert recommendation, citation recommendation and reviewer recommendation, are new and developing topics. With the significant growth of the number of scientific events and journals, one of the most important issues is choosing the most suitable venue for publishing papers, and the existence of a tool to accelerate this process is necessary for researchers. Despite the importance of these systems in accelerating the publication process and decreasing possible errors, this problem has been less studied in related works. So in this paper, an efficient approach will be suggested for recommending related conferences or journals for a researcher's specific paper. In other words, our system will be able to recommend the most suitable venues for publishing a written paper, by means of social network analysis and content-based filtering, according to the researcher's preferences and the co-authors' publication history. We used the minimum available free features and the minimum implementing facilities, which to the best of our knowledge have not seen up to now. In addition, it can be argued that the proposed system overcome the cold start problem which has always been a remarkable task in recommender systems. The results of evaluation using real-world data show acceptable accuracy in venue recommendations. © 2015-Journal Management System.",0,Academic recommender systems; DBLP; Publication venue recommendation;

The list of prospective research areas in this document is usually determined by the judgement of experts whose opinions could be subjective. Meanwhile, a more objective approach has been studied by several researchers to find the emerging research areas by tracking the frequency of scientific publications. This paper investigates the use of this bibliometric approach to identify and forecast the emerging research areas listed in the Indonesian National Research Agenda. Diverse forecast methods are employed and selected based on their performance on previous dataset. In this way, there is no need for training on the current dataset which may reduce time to select the best method. The dataset is compiled from Scopus search engine by querying the research area in question. To construct the historical database, we use the dataset from M1 competition and the testing dataset from NN3 competition as well as time series constructed from query on Scopus. Our experimental results indicate that our model selection may perform well compared to the individual predictor. In addition, the most emerging research topics based on the forecast results can be quantitatively identified.

Current advances in neuroscience leave the brain stem as one of the least known parts of the human central nervous system. Brain stem lesions are particularly damaging to the most important physiological functions. Advances in brain stem modeling may influence important issues within the core of neurology, neurophysiology, neurosurgery, and neurorehabilitation. Direct results may include both development of knowledge and optimization and objectivization of clinical practice in the aforementioned medical areas. Despite these needs, progress in the area of computational brain stem models seems to be too slow. The aims of this paper are both to recognize the strongest limitations in the area of computational brain stem simulations and to assess the extent to which current opportunities may be exploited. Despite limitations, the emerging view of the brain stem provided by its computational models enables a wide repertoire of functions, including core dynamic behavior. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2018.",0,brain stem; central nervous system; computational model; computational neuroscience; neural network,article; brain stem; clinical practice; human; neurology; neurophysiology; neurorehabilitation; neurosurgery; simulation,"Urban, P.P., Caplan, R.S., (2011) Brain Stem Disorders, , Heidelberg Springer; Caplan, L.R., Hopf, H.C., (1993) Brain-stem Localization and Function, , Heidelberg Springer; Kilmer, W., McCulloch, W., Blum, J., A model of the vertebrate central command system (1969) Int J Man-Machine Studies, 1, pp. 279-309; Kilmer, W., A command computer for complex autonomous systems (1997) Neurocomputing, 17, pp. 47-59; Dunin-Barkowski, W.L., Lovering, A.T., Orem, J.M., Baekey, D.M., Dick, T.E., Rybak, I.A., L-plotting-A method for visual analysis of physiological experimental and modeling multi-component data (2010) Neurocomputing, 74, pp. 328-336; Babadi, B., Stimulus transmission by tonic and burst responses in a minimal model of thalamic circuit (2004) Neurocomputing, 58-60, pp. 7-12; Shin, J., Towards computational and robotic modelling of animal cognition and behavior (2002) Neurocomputing, 44-46, pp. 985-992; Gray, R.T., Fung, C.K., Robinson, P.A., Stability of small-world networks of neural populations (1999) Neurocomputing, 72 (7-9), pp. 1565-1574; Humphries, M.D., Gurney, K.N., Prescott, T.J., The brain stem reticular formation is a small world not scale free network (2006) Proc Biol Sci, 273, pp. 503-511; Merker, B., Consciousness without a cerebral cortex: A challenge for neuroscience and medicine (2004) Behav Brain Sci, 30, pp. 63-134; Olmsted, D.D., The recticular formation as a multi-valued logic neural network (1990) Proc Int Joint Conf Neural Networks, 1, pp. 619-624; O'Reilly, R.C., Munakata, Y., Computational explorations in cognitive neuroscience (2000) Understanding the Mind by Simulating the Brain, , Cambridge: MIT Press; Lindsey, B.G., Rybak, I.A., Smith, J.C., Computational models and emergent properties of respiratory neural networks (2012) Compr Physiol, 2, pp. 1619-1670; Humphries, M.D., Gurney, K., Prescott, T.J., Is there an integrative center in the vertebrate brain-stem?

These social interactions of researchers can be well reflected by co-author network, making it feasible to investigate academic community through looking into co-author network, and to study community evolution through dynamic co-author network analysis. Existing metrics measure an author’s impact or centrality in co-author network individually, rather than considering the academic community as a whole. Besides, co-authors of a paper usually make different contributions reflected in the name order, which is often ignored in traditional co-author network analysis. Furthermore, attention has been paid mainly on those structure-level characteristics like the small-world coefficient and the clustering coefficient, the content-level characteristics like community, author, and topics, however, are crucial in the understanding of community evolution. To address those problems, we firstly propose a “comprehensive impact index” to evaluate the author in a co-author network by comprehensively considering the statistic-based impact and the network-based centrality. Then the comprehensive index value of all authors in a community is added up to evaluate the community as a whole. Further, a lifecycle strategy is proposed for the community evolution analysis. Taking geography academic community as a pilot study, we select 919 co-authored papers from the flagship journal of “Annals of the Association of American Geographers”. The co-author groups are generated by community detection method. Top three co-author groups are identified through computing with the proposed index and analyzed through the proposed lifecycle strategy from perspective of community structures, member authors, and impacts respectively. The results demonstrate our proposed index and strategy are more efficient for analyzing academic community evolution than traditional methods. © 2017, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",0,Annals of the Association of American Geographers; Co-author network; Community detection; Lifecycle analysis,,"Balling, R.C., Wells, S.G., Historical rainfall patterns and arroyo activity within the Zuni River drainage basin, New Mexico (1990) Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 80 (4), pp. 603-617; Bastian, M., Heymann, S., Jacomy, M., Gephi: An open source software for exploring and manipulating networks (2009) ICWSM, 8, pp. 361-362; Blondel, V.D., Guillaume, J.-L., Lambiotte, R., Lefebvre, E., Fast unfolding of communities in large networks (2008) Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment, 2008 (10), p.

The evaluation of the topic is briefly addressed by emphasizing Social Sciences. This paper also presents the potentialities of the metric tools which carry out intensive and systematic evaluation exercises. Conditions and characteristic of the research in the field are presented in order to explain its ""professional character"", scarce value given to the theoretical-historical research, incipient existence of national publications, null international visibility of the national scientific production relying on its own sources, nonexistence of a model of research management and of a scientific information system. Potentialities are identified in order to elaborate a solid group of indicators in total harmony with the reality and characteristic of the issue in question, as well as to conceive the evaluation as the central axis of a national scientific politics that motivates research in communication, its management and development.",0,Bibliometric studies; Cuba; Research policy; Scientific evaluation; Scientific research; Social communication,,"Abramo, G., D'Angelo, C.A., Research evaluation: Improvisation or science?

Therefore, researchers take a lot of time to find interesting research papers that are close to their field of specialization. Consequently, in this paper we have proposed documents classification approach that can cluster the text documents of research papers into the meaningful categories in which contain a similar scientific field. Our presented approach based on essential focus and scopes of the target categories, where each of these categories includes many topics. Accordingly, we extract word tokens from these topics that relate to a specific category, separately. The frequency of word tokens in documents impacts on weight of document that calculated by using a numerical statistic of term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF). The proposed approach uses title, abstract, and keywords of the paper, in addition to the categories topics to perform the classification process. Subsequently, documents are classified and clustered into the primary categories based on the highest measure of cosine similarity between category weight and documents weights. © 2021 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

This often helps in locating information easily. TE enables us to define the boundaries of the scientific fields. Text Document Clustering (TDC) represents, in general, the first step of topic identification to identify the documents, which address a related subject matter. Metaheuristics are typically used as efficient approaches for TDC. The multi-verse optimizer algorithm (MVO) involves a stochastic population-based algorithm. It has been recently proposed and successfully utilized to tackle many hard optimization problems. In the TE process, the focus of each statistical TE method is placed on various language feature space aspects. The aim of this paper is to design a novel ensemble method for an automatic TE from a collection of scientific publications based on MVO as the clustering algorithm. The automatic TE, which is used in our approach, is term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), most frequent based keyword extraction (TF), co-occurrence statistical information-based keyword extraction (CSI), TextRank (TR), and mutual information (MI). A group of candidate topics can be provided by each automatic TE method for the proposed ensemble method. Next, the ensemble approach prunes the candidate topics’ set via the application of a specific filtering heuristic. Then, their scores are recalculated based on the prescribed metrics. After that, for selecting a set of topics for certain scientific publications, dynamic threshold functions are applied. The findings emphasized the refined candidate set’s efficiency, as well as effectiveness. The results also showed that the system’s quality has been improved by new topics. The proposed method achieved better precision, as well as recall on a similar dataset compared to the state-of-the-art TE methods. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",1,Ensemble methods;

In the second part, we use the unsupervised combination of GNG clustering with feature maximization metrics and associated contrast graphs to present an analysis of the contents of selected academic journal papers in Science of Science in China and the construction of an overall map of the research topics’ structure during the last 40 years. Furthermore, we highlight how the topics have evolved through analysis of publication dates and also use author information to clarify the topics’ content. The results obtained have been reviewed and approved by 3 leading experts in this field and interestingly show that Chinese Science of Science has gradually become mature in the last 40 years, evolving from the general nature of the discipline itself to related disciplines and their potential interactions, from qualitative analysis to quantitative and visual analysis, and from general research on the social function of science to its more specific economic function and strategic function studies. Consequently, the proposed novel method can be used without supervision, parameters and help from any external knowledge to obtain very clear and precise insights about the development of a scientific domain. The output of the topic extraction part of the method (clustering + feature maximization) is finally compared with the output of the well-known LDA approach by experts in the domain which serves to highlight the very clear superiority of the proposed approach. © 2020, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",1,China; Diachronic analysis; Feature maximization; Science of Science; Topic tracking; Unsupervised learning; World,,"Attik, M., Lamirel, J.-C., Al Shehabi, S., Clustering analysis for data with multiple labels (2006) Proceedings of IASTED International Conference on Databases and Applications (DBA), , Innsbruck, Austria; Bernal, J., (1939) The social function of science, , George Routledge & Sons Ltd, London; Blei, D.M., Ng, A.Y., Jordan, M.I., Latent Dirichlet allocation (2003) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3 (Jan), pp. 993-1022; Caliński, T., Harabasz, J., A dendrite method for cluster analysis (1974) Communications in Statistics-Theory and Methods, 3 (1), pp. 1-27; Chen, Y., Liu, Z., The rise of mapping knowledge domain (2005) Studies in Science of Science, 23 (2), pp. 149-154. , (in Chinese; Chen, Y., Zhang, L., Liu, Z., The prelude of the science of science in the world: The third Copernican revolution initiated in Poland (2017) Studies in Science of Science, 35 (1), pp. 4-10. , (in Chinese; Cuxac, P., Lamirel, J.-C., Analysis of evolutions and interactions between science fields: The cooperation between feature selection and graph representation (2013) 14Th COLLNET Meeting; Davies, D.L., Bouldin, D.W., A cluster separation measure (1979) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 2, pp. 224-227; Dunn, J.C., Well-separated clusters and optimal fuzzy partitions (1974) Journal of Cybernetics, 4 (1), pp. 95-104; Etzkowitz, H., Leydesdorff, L., Universities and the global knowledge economy (1997) A Triple Helix of University-Industry-Government Relations [M], , New York, Pinter; Fortunato, S., Bergstrom, C.T., Börner, K., Evans, J.A., Helbing, D., Milojević, S., (2018) Science of Science, , Science, 10.1126/science.aao0185; Fritzke, B., A growing neural gas network learns topologies (1995) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 625-632; He, Y., Chen, Y., Cui, Y., Liu, Z., Research approaches and prospects in the subject science of science based on the analysis of Bernal Price (2017) Studies in Science of Science, 35 (8), pp. 1121-1129; Hessen, B.M., (1931) The social and economic roots of Newton’s principia, , Science at the Cross Roads, London; Hoffmann, M.D., Blei, D.M., Bach, F., Online learning for Latent Dirichlet allocation (2010) 24Th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), pp. 856-864; Huang, J., Cheng, X.Q., Shen, H.W., Exploring social influence via posterior effect of word-of-mouth recommendations (2012) ACM International CONFERENCE ON WEB SEARCH AND DATA Mining, 2012, pp. 573-582. , ACM; Kassab, R., Lamirel, J.-C., Feature-based cluster validation for high-dimensional data (2008) Proceedings of the 26Th IASTED International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Applications, pp. 232-239. , ACTA Press; Kobourov, S.G., (2012) Spring embedders and force directed graph drawing algorithms; Lamirel, J.-C., Cuxac, P., Chivukula, A.S., Hajlaoui, K., Optimizing text classification through efficient feature selection based on quality metric (2015) Journal of Intelligent Information Systems, 45 (3), pp. 379-396. , (,), . 10.1007/s10844-014-0317-4.

The use of the number of citations allows us to predict the qualitative trends on a paper-by-paper basis. At the same time, it is necessary to be able to comprehensively discuss both qualitative and quantitative aspects in the subject area. This study aimed to detect emerging areas in the nanocarbon field using network models and topic models. It was possible to not only construct a model that exceeded an 86.2% F1 measure but also to focus on an area that could not be detected by the prediction model. This was accomplished by focusing on paper units, such as the research on the chemical synthesis of zigzag single-walled carbon nanotubes. Thus, it is possible to obtain knowledge that contributes to diversified R&D strategies and innovation policies by considering the emergence of new fields from multiple perspectives. © 2020 by the authors.

Methods: Research assessments were performed using the number of publications, the ep index and the probability that a publication reaches the top 0.01% by citation. The ep index reveals an important characteristic of citation distribution. The distribution of the publications from a country in global percentiles follows a power law and the ep index is a mathematical derivative of the exponent of this power law. In addition to its intrinsic value as performance indicator, this index allows calculating a country's probability of publishing highly cited papers and, consequently, of achieving important discoveries or scientific breakthroughs. Findings: Our results show that the USA is scientifically ahead of all countries and that its research is likely to produce approximately 80% of the important global breakthroughs in the research topics investigated in this study. EU research has maintained a constant weak position with reference to USA research over the last 30 years. Countries different from the USA and the EU are increasing enormously their number of publications. Currently, the probability that these publications report an important breakthrough is slightly lower than that of the EU. © 2020 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.",0,Ep index; Percentile distribution; Research evaluation,,"Rodríguez-Navarro, A, Brito, R., Technological research in the EU is less efficient than the world average: EU research policy risks Europeans' future (2018) Journal of Informetrics, 12 (3), pp. 718-731; Röhrig, B, DuPrel, JB, Wachtlin, D, Blettner, M., Types of study in medical research.

Existing techniques from Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) attempt to identify the hidden or unpublished connections between information concepts within published literature, however, these techniques overlooked the concept of predicting the future and emerging relations among scientific knowledge components such as author selected keywords encapsulated within the literature. Keyword Co-occurrence Network (KCN), built upon author selected keywords, is considered as a knowledge graph that focuses both on these knowledge components and knowledge structure of a scientific domain by examining the relationships between knowledge entities. Using data from two multidisciplinary research domains other than the bio-medical domain, and capitalizing on bibliometrics, the dynamicity of temporal KCNs, and a recurrent neural network, this study develops some novel features supportive for the prediction of the future literature-based discoveries - the emerging connections (co-appearances in the same article) among keywords. Temporal importance extracted from both bipartite and unipartite networks, communities defined by genealogical relations, and the relative importance of temporal citation counts were used in the feature construction process. Both node and edge-level features were input into a recurrent neural network to forecast the feature values and predict the future relations between different scientific concepts/topics represented by the author selected keywords. High performance rates, compared both against contemporary heterogeneous network-based method and preferential attachment process, suggest that these features complement both the prediction of future literature-based discoveries and emerging trend analysis. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.",1,Dynamic Supervised Link Prediction;

For this purpose, the relevant bibliographic references from five databases (ERIC, LISA, LISTA, Scopus and WOS) were retrieved. To systematize the keywords, high dimensionality is reduced by means of a term-based process. Fields, topics, sub-topics and top terms are defined. The main top-terms and their relationships are analysed applying the fractional counting methodology using VOSViewer software. Fifteen major themes were set, which were grouped into six clusters to identify the main thematic trends during the period under review: IL and e-learning, Mobile devices and competencies, Ethics, Library and e-resources, Educational technology and Technological environment. The convergence of IL and e-learning, the growth of e-literacy, the increasing relationship between mobile devices and information competencies, as well as that of libraries and e-resources, are thus detected. In conclusion, there is evidence of a growing interdisciplinarity in the scientific publications on Mobile Information Literacy, which interrelates the studies of information and digital literacy with e-learning and mobile technologies. © 2020, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",0,Bibliometric studies; Cluster analysis; e-Learning; e-Literacy; Information literacy; Mobile devices; Mobile information literacy; Mobile learning; Research trends; Term-based method; Visualization,,"Aharony, N., Gazit, T., Factors affecting students’ information literacy self-efficacy (2019) Library Hi Tech, 37 (2), pp. 183-196; Albert, M.A., Sinkinson, C., Composing information literacy: A pedagogical partnership between Rhet/Comp and library faculty (2015) Georgia International Conference on Information Literacy, p. 24. , https://digitalcommons.georgiasouthern.edu/gaintlit/2015/2015/24, Retrieved January 17, 2020, from; Al-Daihani, S., Smartphone use by students for information seeking (2018) Global Knowledge, Memory and Communication, 67 (4-5), pp. 194-208; Arum, R., Roksa, J., (2008) Learning to reason and communicate in college: Initial report of findings from the CLA longitudinal study, , https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED514992, Social Science Research Council.

Due to the large volume of data related to the interactions in science, technology and innovation, there is no choice but to develop and implement accurate models for analysis and decision making. The Quadruple Helix Model examines the scientific outcomes in four spaces of innovation, knowledge, consensus and government with a distinctive attention to the “innovation space”. In other words, it aims to find the connection between the academic space and other sectors of a society (public, media and government) to see if scientific outputs respond appropriately to their needs. Design/methodology/approach: The present paper studied the impact of health-related researches in D8 countries) including Iran, Turkey, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Egypt and Nigeria) using the Altmetrics scores of their indexed journal in the Web of Science (WOS). The results demonstrated distribution of interactions of the mentioned four spaces in health science researches in terms of social media, geographical distribution and theme for D8 countries. This was conducted using content analysis, scientometric and altmetric indicators in the WOS and Altmetrics.com databases. Findings: In D8 countries, more interaction has taken place in the knowledge and innovation spaces; however, there exist Quadruple imbalances in these countries. Moreover, some interactions have been observed in all social networks, displaying that users consider health topics in D8 countries, and clinical sciences has gotten more interaction in all the four spaces. Originality/value: The application of this model using altmetrics data with current approach has been conducted for the first time. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",0,Altmetrics; D8; Mentions; Quadruple helix; Research assessment; Triple helix,,"Aguillo, I., Measuring the institution's footprint in the web (2009) Library Hi Tech, 27 (4), pp. 540-556; Ahmad, B., Sajid, A., Nawaz, H., Rind, M.M., Hassan, B., Maitlo, A., Ruk, S.A., An analysis of Co-relation between social network citation with H-index and its variants (2018) IJCSNS, 18 (5), p. 119; Akbulut, M., Relationships between traditional metrics and altmerics: a case analysis of PLoS (2016) Bilgi Dünyası, 16 (2); Barakat, A.F., Nimri, N., Shokr, M., Mahtta, D., Mansoor, H., Mojadidi, M.K., Elgendy, I.Y., Correlation of Altmetric attention score with article citations in cardiovascular research (2018) Journal of the American College of Cardiology, 72 (8), pp. 952-953. , …; Bazrafshan, A., Haghdoost, A.A., Zare, M., A comparison of downloads, readership and citations data for the Journal of Medical Hypotheses and Ideas (2015) Journal of Medical Hypotheses and Ideas, 9 (1), pp. 1-4; Blazquez, D., Domenech, J., Big data sources and methods for social and economic analyses (2018) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 130, pp. 99-113; Bornmann, L., Haunschild, R., Marx, W., Measuring the societal impact of research: references to climate change research in relevant policy literature (2015) Impact of Social Sciences Blog; Carayannis, E.G., Campbell, D.F., Mode 3'and'Quadruple Helix': toward a 21st century fractal innovation ecosystem (2009) International Journal of Technology Management, 46 (3-4), pp. 201-234; Carayannis, E.G., Campbell, D.F., Open innovation diplomacy and a 21st century fractal research, education and innovation (FREIE) ecosystem: building on the quadruple and quintuple helix innovation concepts and the “mode 3” knowledge production system (2011) Journal of the Knowledge Economy, 2 (3), p. 327; Carayannis, E.G., Campbell, D.F., Innovation systems in conceptual evolution: mode 3 knowledge production in quadruple and quintuple helix innovation systems (2019) Smart Quintuple Helix Innovation Systems, pp. 39-49. , Springer, Cham; Carayannis, E.G., Barth, T.D., Campbell, D.F., The quintuple helix innovation model: global warming as a challenge and driver for innovation (2012) Journal of Innovation and Entrepreneurship, 1 (1), p. 2; Cavacini, A., Recent trends in Middle Eastern scientific production (2016) Scientometrics, 109 (1), pp. 423-432; Chang, J., Desai, N., Gosain, A., Correlation between altmetric score and citations in pediatric surgery core journals (2019) Journal of Surgical Research, 243, pp. 52-58; Chanthes, S., Increasing faculty research productivity via a triple-helix modeled university outreach project: empirical evidence from Thailand (2012) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 52, pp. 253-258; Choi, S., Yang, J.S., Park, H.W., Quantifying the triple helix relationship in scientific research: statistical analyses on the dividing pattern between developed and developing countries (2015) Quality and Quantity, 49 (4), pp. 1381-1396; Confraria, H., Godinho, M.M., The impact of African science: a bibliometric analysis (2015) Scientometrics, 102 (2), pp. 1241-1268; (2019) A guide to the dimensions data approach, , https://dimensions.figshare.com/articles/A_Guide_to_the_Dimensions_Data_Approach/5783094; El-Khouly, M.M., Study on the use and impact of online social networking in Egypt (2015) Journal of Emerging Technologies in Web Intelligence, 7 (1); Etzkowitz, H., Leydesdorff, L., The triple helix--university-industry-government relations: a laboratory for knowledge based economic development (1995) EASST Review, 14 (1), pp. 14-19. , New York; Furnas, H.J., Discussion: social media and the dissemination of research: insights from the most widely circulated articles in plastic surgery (2018) Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, 142 (2), pp. 562-564; (1994) The New Production of Knowledge: The Dynamics of Science and Research in Contemporary Societies, , Gibbons, M.

Hu Q.,57213150093;,The quantitative analysis of difference between Chinese and German libraries subject services,2019,Library Hi Tech,38,2,1,10.1108/LHT-02-2019-0040,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077568300&doi=10.1108%2fLHT-02-2019-0040&partnerID=40&md5=27b784773d94bfd1e569a99f5c2beee5,"School of Foreign Languages, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China","Hu, Q., School of Foreign Languages, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to study the difference of subject service between Chinese and German libraries. Subject service is the key direction of user-oriented service in libraries at home and abroad, especially in university libraries. It is an innovative measure to provide service for teaching, learning and research in libraries under the information environment. Subject service has strong practicality, and with the increasing demand of users and the continuous change of external information environment, the service content and mode are gradually improved. Design/methodology/approach: By investigating the selected websites of University Libraries between China and Germany, the specific practice status of subject services between these two countries was known, and the study provided a basis for the comparative analysis of the practice status of subject services between China and Germany. By using the elastic analysis model, the library services in foreign countries and China can be quantitatively analyzed to find out the matching situation between resources and reader’s needs, and then formulate the countermeasures for the allocation of literature resources. In this way, readers can find out the hotspot topics which are more in line with their needs, as well as in the field of inquiry. It is also helpful for readers to further study and analyze the knowledge background and subject distribution in this field. Findings: The results show that there are still some deficiencies in China’s participation in international scientific research cooperation. By mapping high-frequency keyword co-occurrence network and clustering knowledge map, it is seen that there are differences in user research, information search, subject service platform and other aspects between Chinese and German library subject services. There are also some gaps in such aspects as location, disciplines service website revealing mode, resources support, disciplines service platform and so on. Research limitations/implications: Although this study compares the status of scientific research and practice of discipline services between China and Germany, due to the limited capacity, the paper only selects a number of key points for comparative analysis of discipline services at home and abroad. Due to the limited range of data collected by WOS and Chinese Social Sciences Index, there are some deviations in data processing in the software used, which makes the theoretical research and comparison results have certain limitations. Practical implications: By investigating and analyzing the current situation of subject service in university libraries between China and Germany, this paper points out the shortcomings of subject service in university libraries in China on the basis of comparative analysis and draws on the advanced experience of German subject service to provide guidance for improving the problems in subject service in China. Originality/value: The innovation of this study lies in the comparative analysis of Chinese and German subject services from the perspective of subject service research and work practice and puts forward some strategies to improve the development of domestic subject services. At present, there are few domestic literatures comparing the research status of subject services between China and Germany by using visualization method. This study quantitatively compares the time distribution, knowledge evolution direction, research hotspots and topics of subject services at home and abroad by using visualization technology and summarizes the evolution direction of subject services between China and Germany. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",0,Data analysis;

This analysis relies on previously published information regarding the association of variations to disease progression and possible interventions. Clinicians to a large degree use biomedical search engines to obtain such information; however, the vast majority of scientific publications focus on basic science and have no direct clinical impact. We develop the Variant-Information Search Tool (VIST), a search engine designed for the targeted search of clinically relevant publications given an oncological mutation profile. Results: VIST indexes all PubMed abstracts and content from ClinicalTrials.gov. It applies advanced text mining to identify mentions of genes, variants and drugs and uses machine learning based scoring to judge the clinical relevance of indexed abstracts. Its functionality is available through a fast and intuitive web interface. We perform several evaluations, showing that VIST's ranking is superior to that of PubMed or a pure vector space model with regard to the clinical relevance of a document's content. Conclusion: Different user groups search repositories of scientific publications with different intentions. This diversity is not adequately reflected in the standard search engines, often leading to poor performance in specialized settings. We develop a search engine for the specific case of finding documents that are clinically relevant in the course of cancer treatment. We believe that the architecture of our engine, heavily relying on machine learning algorithms, can also act as a blueprint for search engines in other, equally specific domains.

The development of effective and efficient methods to sort and organize the documents is thus very crucial. Clustering is one of data mining techniques widely applied in various field that may be used to resolve the issue. This paper presents the performance comparison of partitioning-based clustering algorithms, namely random clustering, k-means, x-means, and k-medoids in an unsupervised classification of scientific publications based on topic similarity. Rapidminer is utilized to preprocess and analyze the data. Afterwards, the purity value and processing time of each algorithm are investigated. The results show that k-means performs the best purity value, although its run time is not the fastest. Meanwhile random clustering offers the fastest processing time with the lowest purity value trade-off. None of the observed algorithms produce best purity and processing time at once. It may due to the complex of parameters that affect the clustering results, inter alia, the type of data, selected algorithm, distance measures, and preprocessing methods. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.",1,Clustering; Rapidminer; Text Mining,,"Aggarwal, C.C., Zhai, C., (2012) Mining Text Data, p. 33; Manning, H.S.D.C., Raghavan, P., (2008) Introduction to Information Retrieval; Tong, T., (2010) Semantic Frameworks for Document and Ontology Clustering; Elragal, A., Haddara, M., (2014) Nor.

However, there have not been enough scientific and quantitative studies to elucidate how social communication may deliver physical activity interventions. In this work, we introduce a novel model named Topic-aware Community-level Physical Activity Propagation with Temporal Dynamics (TCPT) to analyze physical activity propagation and social influence at different granularities (i.e., individual level and community level). Given a social network, the TCPT model first integrates the correlations between the content of social communication, social influences, and temporal dynamics. Then, a hierarchical approach is utilized to detect a set of communities and their reciprocal influence strength of physical activities.

Everyone can create their own web content and spread out quickly through online social networks. Massive data has brought severe challenge to public opinion monitoring. We will introduce a microblog public opinion monitoring system based on the Hadoop. It can mine and analyze large scale collected data, realize detection and tracking of hot topics perform social network analysis on the microblog. Network public opinion analysis focuses more on the huge amounts of data collection, storage, cleaning and text clustering, so the traditional public opinion research method only based on data mining is no longer held. This paper summarizes the related literature of the research, sums up the basic process of network public opinion analysis framework, and how to use the distributed computing in all stages of text clustering, thus improving the accuracy and timeliness of the network public opinion analysis. The proposed system will provide automated, systematic, and scientific information support for party and government organizations, enterprises and other units and organizations to detect sensitive information timely, grasp the hot points and the trend of public opinion. © 2016, UK Simulation Society.

The TREC-COVID Challenge was created to evaluate information retrieval (IR) methods and systems for this quickly expanding corpus. Using the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), several dozen research teams participated in over 5 rounds of the TREC-COVID Challenge. While previous work has compared IR techniques used on other test collections, there are no studies that have analyzed the methods used by participants in the TREC-COVID Challenge. We manually reviewed team run reports from Rounds 2 and 5, extracted features from the documented methodologies, and used a univariate and multivariate regression-based analysis to identify features associated with higher retrieval performance. We observed that fine-tuning datasets with relevance judgments, MS-MARCO, and CORD-19 document vectors was associated with improved performance in Round 2 but not in Round 5. Though the relatively decreased heterogeneity of runs in Round 5 may explain the lack of significance in that round, fine-tuning has been found to improve search performance in previous challenge evaluations by improving a system's ability to map relevant queries and phrases to documents. Furthermore, term expansion was associated with improvement in system performance, and the use of the narrative field in the TREC-COVID topics was associated with decreased system performance in both rounds. These findings emphasize the need for clear queries in search. While our study has some limitations in its generalizability and scope of techniques analyzed, we identified some IR techniques that may be useful in building search systems for COVID-19 using the TREC-COVID test collections. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",1,COVID-19; Information retrieval; Search systems; Taxonomy; TREC-COVID,Information retrieval; Natural language processing systems; Regression analysis; Comparative analysis; Document vectors; Journal articles; Multivariate regression; Relevance judgment; Retrieval performance; Scientific publications; Search performance; Search engines,"(2005), https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/30-01-2020-statement-on-the-second-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations–emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov), Statement on the second meeting of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee regarding the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

Assigning appropriate reviewers poses a great challenge for program chairs and journal editors for many reasons, including relevance, fair judgment, no conflict of interest, and qualified reviewers in terms of scientific impact. With a steady increase in the number of research domains, scholarly venues, researchers, and papers in academia, manually selecting and accessing adequate reviewers is becoming a tedious and time-consuming task. Traditional approaches for reviewer selection mainly focus on the matching of research relevance by keywords or disciplines. However, in real-world systems, various factors are often needed to be considered. Therefore, we propose a multilayered approach integrating Topic Network, Citation Network, and Reviewer Network into a reviewer Recommender System (TCRRec). We explore various aspects, including relevance between reviewer candidates and submission, authority, expertise, diversity, and conflict of interest and integrate them into the proposed framework TCRRec. The paper also addresses cold start issues for researchers having unique areas of interest or for isolated researchers.

The high amount of manual effort required to this end indicates that the way knowledge has been structured and visualized until the present day should be improved in software tools. Nowadays, scientific domains are organized based on citation networks or bag-of-words techniques, disregarding the intrinsic semantics of concepts presented in literature documents. We propose a novel approach to structure scientific fields, which uses semantic analysis from natural language texts to construct knowledge graphs. Then, our approach clusters knowledge graphs in their main topics and automatically extracts information such as the most relevant concepts in topics and overlapping concepts between topics. We evaluate the proposed model in two datasets from distinct areas. The results achieve up to 84% of accuracy in the task of document classification without using annotated data to segment topics from a set of input documents. Our solution identifies coherent keyphrases and key concepts considering the dataset used. The SciKGraph framework contributes by structuring knowledge that might aid researchers in the study of their areas, reducing the effort and amount of time devoted to groundwork. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.",1,Document classification; Knowledge graphs; Knowledge representation; Overlap clustering; Semantic annotation,Information retrieval systems; Knowledge representation; Semantics; Citation networks; Document Classification; Knowledge graphs; Natural language text; Scientific fields; Semantic analysis; Specific information; Structuring knowledge; Graph structures,"Altman, N.S., An introduction to kernel and nearest-neighbor nonparametric regression (1992) The American Statistician, 46 (3), pp. 175-185; Aria, M., Cuccurullo, C., Bibliometrix: An r-Tool for comprehensive science mapping analysis (2017) Journal of Informetrics, 11 (4), pp. 959-975; https://babelnet.org/about, Babelnet | the largest multilingual encyclopedic and semantic network.

When we explore the factors that affect consumers' choice of e-commerce transactions, e-commerce trust is undoubtedly an important breakthrough in this issue. E-commerce trust can have a profound impact on the popularity of e-commerce among customers and the future development. But in the current environment, consumers are still unfamiliar or skeptical about e-commerce. Based on these problems, this paper proposes a cross-border e-commerce trust model based on the existing trust evaluation technology, machine learning theory and the cloud model in Bayesian network technology to prevent fraud. With the support of cloud model, trust evaluation method has been improved. Trust has changed from qualitative to quantitative, and the relevant data can reflect the nature of trust more intuitively and objectively. In addition, the model can also start from the enterprise, according to the e-commerce enterprise for consumer privacy protection, information trading and other services to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the enterprise, giving consumers a clearer choice. In addition, the evaluation quantity and adaptive time window algorithm are also introduced in the evaluation of e-commerce enterprises. All kinds of measures are to prevent illegal businesses from misleading consumers by credit fraud and speculation. Through the above methods, researchers can understand the trust degree of users for cross-border e-commerce, and put forward relevant methods to improve user credit. At the same time, through a variety of theoretical methods such as machine learning and Bayesian network, we can provide enterprises with more market and user demand information, make them aware of the shortcomings and constantly improve their business in the future, so as to improve the trust of users to enterprises, and attract a wider user group, so as to provide more ideas and guidance for the development of cross-border e-commerce. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",0,Bayesian network; Cross border e-commerce; Machine learning; Trust model,Bayesian networks; Cloud computing; Consumer protection; Crime; Electronic commerce; Engineering education; Machine learning; Network security; Privacy by design; Comprehensive evaluation; Consumer privacy; E-commerce enterprise; E-commerce transactions; Network technologies; Scientific researches; Theoretical methods; Trust evaluation; Trusted computing,"Abulkasim, H., Farouk, A., Alsuqaih, H., Hamdan, W., Hamad, S., Ghose, S., Improving the security of quantum key agreement protocols with single photon in both polarization and spatial-mode degrees of freedom (2018) Quantum Inf Process, 17 (11), pp. 316-320; Abulkasim, H., Farouk, A., Hamad, S., Mashatan, A., Ghose, S., Secure dynamic multiparty quantum private comparison (2019) Sci Rep, 9 (1), pp. 1-16; Nweke, H.F., Teh, Y.W., Al-Garadi, M.A., Alo, U.R., Deep learning algorithms for human activity recognition using mobile and wearable sensor networks: state of the art and research challenges (2018) Expert Syst Appl, 105, pp. 233-261; Oniga, S., Sütő, J., Human activity recognition using neural networks (2014) Proceedings of the 2014 15Th International Carpathian Control Conference (ICCC), IEEE, pp. 403-406; Osmani, V., Balasubramaniam, S., Botvich, D., Human activity recognition in pervasive health-care: supporting efficient remote collaboration (2008) J Netw Comput Appl, 31 (4), pp. 628-655; Paul, P., George, T., An effective approach for human activity recognition on smartphone.

As a research discipline, gamification is growing fast, maturing from basic and fundamental questions such as what and why gamify to more mature ones such as how to gamify, when and when not, and still facing empirical and theoretical challenges to prove the effects of its practice and consolidate the principles that guide meaningful gamification designs. The purpose of this paper is to conduct a bibliometric study to describe how gamification as a scientific discipline is structured and how it has evolved over time. To do this, we make use of bibliometric performance analysis and science mapping methods to display and analyze the intellectual, conceptual and social network structures of gamification research, as well as the evolution and dynamical aspects of the discipline. The results reveal the research fronts and intellectual structures of the field, the internal relationships among articles, authors and keywords, the existing networks of collaboration, the emerging trends, the hot topics, and the most influential authors, publications and sources. Together, they picture the intellectual landscape of gamification as a scientific field that will be useful for junior and senior researchers, practitioners, funding agencies and policymakers.

The substantial resources required by these projects limits the number of studies that can be repeated and consequently the generalizability of the findings. We extend the use of a method from Jager and Leek to estimate the false discovery rate for 94 journals over a 5-year period using p values from over 30,000 abstracts enabling the study of how the false discovery rate varies by journal characteristics. Results: We find that the empirical false discovery rate is higher for cancer versus general medicine journals (p = 9.801E−07, 95% CI: 0.045, 0.097; adjusted mean false discovery rate cancer = 0.264 vs. general medicine = 0.194). We also find that false discovery rate is negatively associated with log journal impact factor. A two-fold decrease in journal impact factor is associated with an average increase of 0.020 in FDR (p = 2.545E−04). Conversely, we find no statistically significant evidence of a higher false discovery rate, on average, for Open Access versus closed access journals (p = 0.320, 95% CI − 0.015, 0.046, adjusted mean false discovery rate Open Access = 0.241 vs. closed access = 0.225). Conclusions: Our results identify areas of research that may need additional scrutiny and support to facilitate replicable science. Given our publicly available R code and data, others can complete a broad assessment of the empirical false discovery rate across other subject areas and characteristics of published research. © 2020, The Author(s).",0,Cancer; False discovery rate; Impact factor; Open access; Replication; Reproducibility,Diseases; Closed access; False discovery rate; High-throughput analysis; Impact factor; P-values; Open access; human; journal impact factor; open access publishing; publication; Humans; Journal Impact Factor; Open Access Publishing; Periodicals as Topic,"Baker, M., Psychology's reproducibility problem is exaggerated—say psychologists (2016) Nature, 563, p. 267; Begley, C.G., Ellis, L.M., Drug development: raise standards for preclinical cancer research (2012) Nature, 483 (7391), pp. 531-533. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC38Xks1yrs7k%3D; Ioannidis, J.P., Why most published research findings are false (2005) PLoS Med, 2 (8); Ioannidis, J.P., Contradicted and initially stronger effects in highly cited clinical research (2005) JAMA, 294 (2), pp. 218-228. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD2MXmtlSltro%3D; Ioannidis, J.P., Allison, D.B., Ball, C.A., Coulibaly, I., Cui, X., Culhane, A.C., Falchi, M., Jurman, G., Repeatability of published microarray gene expression analyses (2009) Nat Genet, 41 (2), pp. 149-155. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD1MXhtVGitrk%3D; Estimating the reproducibility of psychological science (2015) Science, 349 (6251); Pusztai, L., Hatzis, C., Andre, F., Reproducibility of research and preclinical validation: problems and solutions (2013) Nat Rev Clin Oncol, 10 (12), pp. 720-724; Baggerly, K., Coombes, K., Deriving chemosensitivity from cell lines: Forensic bioinformatics and reproducible research in high-throughput biology (2009) Ann Appl Stat, 3, pp. 1309-1334; (2019) Reproducibility and Replicability in Science, , https://sites.nationalacademies.org/dbasse/bbcss/reproducibility_and_replicability_in_science/index.htm; Mesirov, J.P., Computer science.

However, citation frequencies of books are single numerical evaluation metrics. It neglects details about books (e.g. contents), which may lead to the decline in comprehensiveness of evaluation results. Hence, fine-grained mining on books’ citation information to integrate frequency metrics and content metrics can obtain more reliable evaluation results. Books’ citation literatures (i.e. literatures cited books) present citation frequencies of books, and reflect citation intentions, topics and domains simultaneously. Existing research focused on analysing citation frequencies, authors or citation contexts of citation literatures to conduct citation analysis. It may be costly for collecting citation contexts and neglected latent information of citation literatures, such as impact scopes or topics of books reflected by citation literatures. Therefore, in this paper, we conducted fine-grained analysis on books’ citation literatures to assess whether citation literatures could be systematically used for indicators of books’ wider impacts. Specifically, we firstly collected books and corresponding information about their citation literatures. Then, we extracted multi-dimensional metrics via multi-granularity mining on citation literatures, and got assessment results by integrating content-level and frequency-level metrics. Finally, we compared assessment results based on citation literatures and existing metrics for assessing books’ impacts to verify assessment results. Experimental results infer that citation literatures are a promising source for book impact assessment, especially books’ academic impacts. © 2020, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",0,Citation analysis; Content mining; Library holdings; Topic model; Wider impact assessment,,"Adriaanse, L.S., Rensleigh, C., Web of science, Scopus and Google Scholar: A content comprehensiveness comparison (2013) The Electronic Library, 31 (6), pp. 727-744; Barilan, J., Citations to the “Introduction to informetrics” indexed by WOS (2010) Scopus and Google Scholar.

The discovery of effective service is the key to achieve a higher level of ubiquity, which ensures the availability of services to users and applications significantly, and the high use of services. The research in this field is limited, with a few SD protocols available for specific purposes specified in the 6LoWPAN region. This paper discusses the various issues and challenges facing the design and selection of the appropriate service discovery and cluster-based mechanism. Moreover, attention has been drawn to the cross-layer solution by discussing different clustering techniques used to solve the redundancy problems. Furthermore, the service discovery protocols and cluster-based routing protocols are critically investigated considering the redundancy problem, methods, mechanisms, and architectures by categorizing them into different categories, comparing them with fundamental parameters in the WSNs and MANETs environments. In addition, a modern form is proposed to show the life cycle of the service discovery process, and a new figure has been designed to clarify to the researchers various of the open issues related to the service discovery and cluster-based routing protocols, corresponding objectives and the techniques of solving problems. Through the discussion of the scientific papers under survey, important results and valuable recommendations were reached. The survey is concluded with a summary, open research issues, outlook, and directions for future research on the topic. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",0,6LoWPAN; clustering; mobile ad hoc network; redundancy; service discovery; wireless sensor network,Internet protocols; Life cycle; Network architecture; Redundancy; Routing protocols; Surveys; Wireless sensor networks; Cluster based routing protocols; Clustering techniques; Issues and challenges; Redundancy problems; Scientific papers; Service discovery; Service discovery process; Service discovery protocol; Mobile ad hoc networks,"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even less research has been carried out on the effects of better representation of women in terms of research and innovation. This paper is based on the application of an innovative evaluation framework, which encompasses complexity and theory of change approaches and aims at exploring the link between interventions and their subsequent effects to two case studies. We discuss two major German flagship programmes aiming at increasing the participation of female researchers in the science system, the “Women Professorship Programme” and the “Pact for Research and Innovation”. Through the two programmes, we tested and validated the evaluation framework and its indicators. As part of the validation process, a theory of change has been developed for each of the programmes. The theory-based evaluation approach helped not only to identify gender equality impacts but also broader effects on research and innovation that might have otherwise remained undetected. We studied the effects of the two programmes on the number of women in leadership positions and analysed whether an increase in the proportion of women leaders influences publication patterns. Although linear linkages are challenging to establish due to the complexity of the process, the findings suggest that the flagship programmes have contributed not only to higher shares of women researchers but also to improved female publication and citation rates. There are clear benefits for Germany in terms of scientific results from the increased proportion of female researchers in research and innovation. © 2020, The Author(s).",0,Bibliometrics; Evaluation; Flagship programmes; Gender equality; Research and innovation; Theory of change,,"Bilimoria, D., Wheeler, J., Women corporate directors: Current research and future directions (2000) Current Research Issues, 2, pp. 138-163; Federal Ministry of Education and Science (Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung) (2016) Pakt für Forschung Und Innovation, , https://www.bmbf.de/de/pakt-fuer-forschung-und-innovation-546.html, Retrieved March 13, 2018, from; (2018) Bekanntmachung.

Simultaneously, how to ensure fast and safe information transmission becomes the research topic of the information age. The improvement of this research is based on the traditional fine-grained algorithm, and this study uses spatial constraints and evaluation scores to obtain the bounding box positions of objects and objects. Simultaneously, Part-based R-CNN is used to extract convolution features for each filtered bounding box and join the local features to form a feature representation vector. In addition, the research is based on the application of high-resolution acquisition of information entropy, abnormal signal detection and transient signal measurement methods and techniques in typical time domain test instruments, that is, digital oscilloscope, and this study is experimentally verified. The research indicates that the method proposed in this paper is scientific and can provide theoretical reference for subsequent related research. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",0,Data transmission;

While these publications offer rich and valuable information, the scale of the datasets makes it difficult for the researchers to manage and search for desired information efficiently. Literature Explorer is a new interactive visual analytics suite that facilitates the access to desired scientific literatures through mining and interactive visualisation. We propose a novel topic mining method that is able to uncover “thematic topics” from a scientific corpus. These thematic topics have an explicit semantic association to the research themes that are commonly used by human researchers in scientific fields, and hence are human interpretable. They also contribute to effective document retrieval. The visual analytics suite consists of a set of visual components that are closely coupled with the underlying thematic topic detection to support interactive document retrieval. The visual components are adequately integrated under the design rationale and goals. Evaluation results are given in both objective measurements and subjective terms through expert assessments. Comparisons are also made against the outcomes from the traditional topic modelling methods. © 2019, The Author(s).",0,Data visualisation; Scientific documents; Text mining; Topic explorer; Topic modelling; Web application,Data visualization; Semantics; Visualization; Interactive documents; Interactive visualisation; Objective measurement; Scientific documents; Scientific literature; Text mining; Topic explorer; WEB application; Information retrieval,"Blei, D.M., Ng, A.Y., Jordan, M.I., Latent dirichlet allocation (2003) J.

In this paper, we propose a supervised relation topic model that leverages the links between documents to learn the latent content of documents and enhance performance of prediction. Our model takes advantage of Bayesian generative model to exploit the relation between word feature and link feature in a document network. We evaluate our model on large-scale data collections that include scientific citation community and medical article network. We demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency on document classification with SLDA model and collective classification approaches. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",1,Document classification; Link analysis; Multi-classification; Topic modeling,Computer programming; Computer science; Bayesian generative models; Collective classifications; Document Classification; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Large scale data; Link analysis; Multi-classification; Topic Modeling; Information retrieval systems,"Neville, J., Jensen, D., Iterative classification in relational data (2000) Proceedings of AAAI-2000 Workshop on Learning Statistical Models from Relational Data, pp. 13-20; Jensen, D., Neville, J., Gallagher, B., Why collective inference improves relational classification (2004) Proceedings of the 10Th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 593-598. , ACM; Macskassy, S.A., Provost, F., Classification in networked data: a toolkit and a univariate case study (2007) J Mach Learn Res, 8 (May), pp. 935-983; Quan, X., Liu, G., Lu, Z., Ni, X., Wenyin, L., Short text similarity based on probabilistic topics (2010) Knowl Inf Syst, 25 (3), pp. 473-491; Rodrigues, F., Lourenco, M., Ribeiro, B., Pereira, F.C., Learning supervised topic models for classification and regression from crowds (2017) IEEE Trans Pattern Anal Mach Intell, 39 (12), pp. 2409-2422; Blei, D.M., Ng, A.Y., Jordan, M.I., Latent dirichlet allocation (2003) J Mach Learn Res, 3 (Jan), pp. 993-1022; Cambria, E., Rajagopal, D., Olsher, D., Das, D., Big social data analysis (2013) Big Data Comput, 2013, pp. 401-414; Rajagopal, D., Olsher, D., Cambria, E., Kwok, K., Commonsense-based topic modeling (2013) Proceedings of the 2Nd International Workshop on Issues of Sentiment Discovery and Opinion Mining.

However, evaluating what is effectively learned by students is a challenging task. Considering multiple-choice written exams are a standard evaluation format, this study aimed to uncover the features influencing students’ success in answering these types of questions. The empirical experiments were based on Excel evaluation exams containing questions answered by 526 students between 2012 and 2016, with a total of 3,340 answers characterized by 17 features. Through data mining, a neural network was developed that accurately modeled students’ choices. A sensitivity analysis was applied to the model to assess the most relevant features. Findings identified four highly relevant features for students’ success: number of words of the question, topic, difficulty degree, and number of similar choices. This study helps to guide the design of future exams by quantifying the individual influence of each feature. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",0,Data mining; Excel; feature relevance; multiple-choice questions; students’ performance,Data mining; Sensitivity analysis; Empirical experiments; Microsoft excel; Multiple choice questions; Relevant features; Standard evaluations; Student success; Technical tools; University programs; Students,"Al Rawahi, F.K., Khan, S.A., Huq, A., Microsoft EXCEL in the mathematics classroom: A case study (2006) Proceedings of the Second Middle East Teachers of Science, Mathematics and Computing Conference (METSMaC), pp. 131-134. , Stewart S.M., Olearski J.E., Thompson D., (eds), Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates: The Petroleum Institute, &,.

Due to the lack of topic analysis frameworks optimized specifically for cancer data, the studies on topic modeling in cancer research still have a strong challenge. Recently, deep learning (DL) based approaches were successfully employed to learn semantic and contextual information from scientific documents using word embeddings according to the hallmarks of cancer (HoC). However, those are only applicable to labeled data. There is a comparatively small number of documents that are labeled by experts. In the real world, there is a massive number of unlabeled documents that are available online. In this paper, we present a multi-task topic analysis (MTTA) framework to analyze cancer hallmark-specific topics from documents. The MTTA framework consists of three main subtasks: (1) cancer hallmark learning (CHL)-used to learn cancer hallmarks on existing labeled documents; (2) weak label propagation (WLP)-used to classify a large number of unlabeled documents with the pre-trained model in the CHL task; and (3) topic modeling (ToM)-used to discover topics for each hallmark category. In the CHL task, we employed a convolutional neural network (CNN) with pre-trained word embedding that represents semantic meanings obtained from an unlabeled large corpus. In the ToM task, we employed a latent topic model such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) model to catch the semantic information learned by the CNN model for topic analysis. To evaluate the MTTA framework, we collected a large number of documents related to lung cancer in a case study. We also conducted a comprehensive performance evaluation for the MTTA framework, comparing it with several approaches. © 2020 by the authors.",0,Biomedical domain; Cancer hallmark; Convolutional neural network; Latent semantic learning; Lung cancer; Multi-task learning; Semantic learning; Topic analysis,,"Mehmet Sitki Copur, M.D., State of Cancer Research around the Globe (2019) Oncology, 14, p. 33; Hanahan, D., Weinberg, R.A., (2000) The hallmarks of cancer, 100, pp. 57-70. , Cell [CrossRef]; Hanahan, D., Weinberg, R.A., (2011) Hallmarks of cancer: The next generation, 144, pp. 646-674. , Cell [CrossRef]; Gutschner, T., Diederichs, S., The hallmarks of cancer: A long non-coding RNA point of view (2012) RNA Biol, 9, pp. 703-719. , [CrossRef] [PubMed]; Piao, Y., Piao, M., Ryu, K.H., Multiclass cancer classification using a feature subset-based ensemble from microRNA expression profiles (2017) Comput.

However, how to guarantee the safety of their online behaviors has been a topic of public concern, and the trust of node behaviors in the network has become one of the significant guarantees. A trust model based on fuzzy similarity is proposed in this article in accordance with the features of node behaviors. Firstly, the evaluation message is given to various nodes, and the theory of fuzzy similarity is applied to process the evaluation message. Through integrating these evaluation message, the rules of node behaviors are obtained, Besides, for the malicious and selfish nodes, the trust update algorithm is proposed. Simulation results show the effectiveness and scientific of the mode proposed. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Following the pioneering milestone of h-index, many variants have been proposed and but still suffer some limitations. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale h-index (MH-index, or Ma-Huang index) to comprehensively measure the scientific impact of scholars based on the publication record. We investigate the index from the mathematical perspective of correlation function between citation count and paper number. We reveal that different definitions of the correlation function lead to different index schemes. By defining the correlation functions with gradually varied slope, we can obtain a series of index elements, each of which captures the citation record in different granularities. Our approach can be essentially interpreted as a generalized h-index in multiple scales, which is obtained by first generating a multi-scale representation of a scholar&#x2019;s paper citation record and then calculating the h-index score for each scale. Our approach can be extended to consider all publication citations and subtly emphasizes those highly cited publications. To validate the proposed indicators, an experimental study is conducted on 82 scholars in the scientometrics field and comparison is made with several existing indices.

A probabilistic thematic model was built to make it possible to cluster the publications of scholars in scientific areas, taking into account the citation network, which was an important step for solving the problem of identifying scientific subject spaces. As a result of constructing the model, the problem of increasing instability of clustering the citation graph in connection with a decrease in the number of clusters was solved. This problem would arise when combining clusters built on the basis of citation graph clustering, taking into account the similarity of abstracts of scientific publications. In the article, the presentation of text documents is described based on a probabilistic thematic model using n-grams. A probabilistic thematic model was built for the task of determining the completeness of covering the materials of an author's dissertation research in scientific publications. The approximate values of the threshold coefficients were calculated to evaluate whether the articles of an author included the research provisions that were reflected in the text of the author's abstract of the dissertation. The probabilistic thematic model for an author's publications was practised on the basis of the BigARTM tool. Using the constructed model and with the help of a special regularizer, a matrix was found to evaluate the relevance of topics specified by the segments of an author's dissertation abstracts to documents that are produced by the author's publications. Important aspects of the possibilities of using latent semantic analysis were studied to identify tasks of scientific subject spaces and to reveal the completeness of covering the results of dissertation research science degree seekers © 2020",1,clustering; probabilistic latent semantic analysis; scientific subject space; thematic model,,"Dumais, S.

He was a productive and influential scientist, both in quantitative and in qualitative studies. To cherish the memory of Professor Liu and in praise of his scientific thoughts and scientific spirit, we explored his academic career rhythm based on our rhythm indicator of science. The rhythm indicator is created based on a publication-citation matrix, eliminating the impact of length of citation windows, making citations comparable for different years. In Liu’s rhythm study the publication indicator and citation indicator are combined. Data were retrieved from China National Knowledge Infrastructure and WoS. The most important finding is that Liu’s academic career rhythm is totally different from that of two famous western scientists T. Braun and R. Rousseau. Because of the delayed scientific research by China’s Cultural Revolution, it was only in 1979 that Liu published his first scientific paper and launched his academic career. In the first 20 years he published 41 papers, mostly single-authored. Their research topics were scattered and mainly used qualitative methods. In 1999 Liu changed his research paradigm from qualitative to quantitative studies, focusing on scientometrics, citation analysis and knowledge mapping. New topics, new methods and multi-authored collaboration greatly increased his productivity (293 articles) and influence. The above exploration is based on both whole counting of publications/citations and fractional counting. Three problems, including the normalization of the p–c matrix, are discussed. The rhythm indicator of science is a contribution to the evaluation methodology for scientist-level and journal-level scientific impact. © 2020, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",0,Citation rhythm indicator; Compound rhythm indicator; Fractional counting; Professor Zeyuan Liu; Scientist’s academic career rhythm; Whole counting,,"Chen, Y., Chen, C., Liu, Z., The methodology function of CiteSpace mapping knowledge domains (2015) Studies in Science of Science, 33, pp. 242-253. , (in Chinese; Egghe, L., Liang, L.M., Rousseau, R., Fundamental properties of rhythm sequences (2008) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 59, pp. 1469-1478; Hu, X.J., Leydesdorff, L., Rousseau, R., Exponential growth in the number of items in the WoS (2020) ISSI Newsletter, 16 (2), pp. 32-38; Jin, B.H., Li, L., Rousseau, R., Long-term influences of interventions in the normal development of science: China and the Cultural Revolution (2004) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 55 (6), pp. 544-550; Leydesdorff, L., The organization of the semantic space of an author (1992) Scientometrics, 60, pp. 19-24; Leydesdorff, L., (2002) 3-8).

This is a new phenomenon that has rarely been considered in the subject literature so far, which may be interesting for the fields of social sciences and humanities. The aim is to describe the features of this technology and determine the practical and ethical problems associated with its implementation in libraries. Design/methodology/approach: The method of literature review was used. Systematic searches according to specific questions were carried out using the Scopus and Web of Science scientific databases, as well as Google Scholar and the LISTA abstract database. Findings: The results established that the issue of augmented intelligence has barely been discussed in the field of librarianship. Although this technology may be interesting as a new area of librarian research and as a new framework for designing innovative services, deep ethical consideration is necessary before this technology is introduced in libraries. Research limitations/implications: The article deals with some of the newest technologies available, and this topic is generally very rarely discussed in scientific publications in either the social sciences or humanities. Therefore, due to the limited availability of materials, the findings presented in the article are primarily of a conceptual nature. The aim is to present this topic from the perspective of librarianship and to create a starting point for further discussion on the ethical aspects of introducing new technologies in libraries. Practical implications: The results can be widely used in practice as a framework for the implementation of augmented intelligence in libraries. Social implications: The article can help to facilitate the debate on the role of implementing new technologies in libraries. Originality/value: The problem of augmented intelligence is very rarely addressed in the subject literature in the field of library and information science. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",0,Augmented intelligence; Emerging technologies; Information technologies; Library services; Library trends,,"ALA - American Library Association, (2008) Professional ethics, , http://www.ala.org/tools/ethics, accessed, 26 November 2019; Arieno, A., Chan, A., Destounis, S.V., A review of the role of augmented intelligence in breast imaging: from automated breast density assessment to risk stratification (2019) American Journal of Roentgenology, 212 (2), pp. 259-270; Bailey, J., Data protection in UK library and information services: are we ready for GDPR?

This article discusses a new scientometric approach towards the identification of trends in highlycited computer technology publications, artificial intelligence publications specifically. The approach in question is based on the bibliographic and thematic analyses of disciplines and impliesthe review of academic profiles in Google Scholar (GS). By reviewing top journals and GS metrics of artificial intelligence articles published in the last five years (2014/2019), a set of key terms was identified that defined the research field the direction. Thefrequency analysis of terms revealed the behavior patterns of the current trendsin artificial intelligence research. The analysis of profiles and highly-cited articles showed that paper citation is influenced by the following factors:appropriate word choices and the frequency of their occurrence in publications and academic profiles. A link was found between the number of keywordsdefining the trend and the number of citations. The study showed that the citation count depends not only on the popularity of the topic but also on the journal’s editorial policies, on the occurrence of hot terms in the paper title, keywords, in the text of an article, and in the academic profile of the author. The trend evaluation algorithm proposed in this study can be applied to research papers in diverse fields to determine their relevance and citation life cycles. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

However, the large and rapidly increasing publication rate makes it impractical for researchers to quickly identify all and only those documents related to their interest. As such, automated biomedical document classification attracts much interest. Such classification is critical in the curation of biological databases, because biocurators must scan through a vast number of articles to identify pertinent information within documents most relevant to the database. This is a slow, labor-intensive process that can benefit from effective automation. We present a document classification scheme aiming to identify papers containing information relevant to a specific topic, among a large collection of articles, for supporting the biocuration classification task. Our framework is based on a meta-classification scheme we have introduced before; here we incorporate into it features gathered from figure captions, in addition to those obtained from titles and abstracts. We trained and tested our classifier over a large imbalanced dataset, originally curated by the Gene Expression Database (GXD). GXD collects all the gene expression information in the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) resource. As part of the MGI literature classification pipeline, GXD curators identify MGI-selected papers that are relevant for GXD. The dataset consists of ~60 000 documents (5469 labeled as relevant; 52 866 as irrelevant), gathered throughout 2012-2016, in which each document is represented by the text of its title, abstract and figure captions. Our classifier attains precision 0.698, recall 0.784, f-measure 0.738 and Matthews correlation coefficient 0.711, demonstrating that the proposed framework effectively addresses the high imbalance in the GXD classification task. Moreover, our classifier's performance is significantly improved by utilizing information from image captions compared to using titles and abstracts alone; this observation clearly demonstrates that image captions provide substantial information for supporting biomedical document classification and curation. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Existing formulations model mobility-on-demand systems in a queuing theoretical, network flow-based, or continuous, kinematic framework. In this work, we model a mobility-on-demand system as a stochastic differential equation that represents a generalization of previous approaches. Based on the model, we define system imbalance as the difference of the stochastic processes of service request arrival and vehicle arrival. We formally derive the first moment of the system imbalance for an imbalance control strategy that consists of a feedforward control approach (reference trajectory) and an additional feedback component. A distributed feedback control policy is defined that averages the imbalance across the system and therefore aims at a uniform quality of service distribution. Finally, we verify our results in a high-fidelity and large-scale agent-based simulation of a hypothetical mobility-on-demand system. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",0,Autonomous systems; Distributed control; Mobility-on-demand; Quantized consensus; Rebalancing; Stochastic systems,Differential equations; Distributed parameter control systems; Feedback; Feedforward control; Quality control; Quality of service; Random processes; Stochastic control systems; Stochastic systems; Autonomous systems; Distributed control; On demands; Quantized consensus; Rebalancing; Stochastic models; algorithm; control system; Lotka-Volterra model; model; simulation; stochasticity,"Munoz-Mendez, F., Klemmer, K., Han, K., Jarvis, S., (2018) Community Structures, Interactions and Dynamics in London's Bicycle Sharing Network; Claudio, R., Warrington, J., Morari, M., Rule-based price control for bike sharing systems (2014) Proceedings of the European Control Conference (ECC'14).

Many available scientific publications evidence the interest of researchers in this area. Within a time span of eight years from 2011 to 2018, approximately 2600, 230, 150, and 110 scientific articles were published from the USA, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, respectively around this area of research. To comprehensively survey all the sub-fields and interests within this research area, the present paper proposes a novel density-based method for finding topic descriptors from academic articles. By employing a robust to noise fuzzy clustering algorithm, the terms are clustered, and by utilizing a modified Parzen window, k topic descriptors from each cluster are extracted. Besides, an optimization problem has been designed to detect the similarity between word pairs. By conducting the experiments, the research priorities for four countries within this time span have been found. Moreover, the closeness of the research in developing countries to the developed country have been measured. The experimental results show that for four years, the research topics in Turkey were close to the research topics in the USA on average, and the research topics in Saudi Arabia were close to the USA topics during the past two years. Additionally, the experimental comparison of the proposed method with two clustering baselines indicates the superiority of the proposed method in terms of precision, recall, and accuracy. © 2019 The Authors",1,Collaborative research; Fuzzy clustering; Probability density function; Text mining; Text-similarity; Topic detection,,"Ai, W., Li, K., Li, K., An effective hot topic detection method for microblog on spark (2018) Appl.

It presents concepts about scientific and technological information and the processes that involve its uses, as well as scientific communication, information flows and sources of information. The methodology used is a descriptive study with a quantitative-qualitative approach, using bibliometrics techniques for index measurement and Bardin content analysis. Thirty - six papers were analyzed, while the qualitative ones were twenty - one abstracts. The results show that the most published journal about the term researched was ""Information and Society"", the year with the highest number of publications was 2016. Multiple authorship was a trend observed in the articles and the most used keywords were: free access, Scientific and technological information and digital preservation. As for the content of the abstracts, it was possible to identify them within three categories of analysis, namely: information science and processes involving the use of information; Production, communication and evaluation of scientific and technological activity; And scientific and technological development. It is concluded that there is a tendency of the literature analyzed to return to the study of the information itself, of methodologies applied in studies and also of information products and services. The abstracts addressed topics such as institutional repository, bibliometrics, coauthoring, management of scientific journals and scientific and technological information policies. © RDBCI: Rev.

The method adopted was a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on studies published from 2009 to May 2015. Many topics were analised in the selected papers of this research. Firstly, KM practices found were categorized according to Ho (2009). Secondly, the financial indicators used were compared to indicators identified by Combs; Crook; Shook (2005). Thirdly, the most frequently measures used in the relationship between KM practices and financial performance were identified. Finally, we highlighted the most used methods to evaluate impact of KM in FP, evaluation of number of Publications per year and evaluation of Authors, Publishers. The paper finds that in despite of increasing number of publications correlating both topics the effects of KM in financial performance has to be more explored.
